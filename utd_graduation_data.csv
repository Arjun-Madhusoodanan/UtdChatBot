Although not conclusive or exhaustive, the following factors occurring throughout a consecutive 12-month period prior to the census date of the semester in which a person seeks to enroll may lend support to a claim regarding his/her intent to establish domicile in Texas. Continued presence in the state from the end of that period until the census date of the semester in which a person seeks to enroll, except for temporary absences as defined in §21.22(28), may lend support to a claim of maintaining domicile in Texas: (i) An employer’s statement of dates of employment in Texas (beginning and current or ending dates) that encompass at least 12 consecutive months prior to the census date of the term in which the person enrolls or pay stubs for 12 consecutive months prior to the census date, reflecting significant gainful employment in Texas, or proof of other earned income such as pensions, veterans’ benefits, social security, and savings from previous earnings for 12 consecutive months prior to the census date. However, employment conditioned on student status, such as work study, the receipt of stipends, fellowships, or research or teaching assistantships does not constitute gainful employment for the purposes of this subchapter. (ii) For a person who is unemployed and living on public assistance, written statements from the office of one or more social service agencies located in Texas that attest to the provision of services to the person for the 12 consecutive months prior to the census date of the term in which the person enrolls. (B) Residential Real Property. Sole or joint marital ownership of residential real property in Texas with documentation to verify 12 consecutive months of ownership prior to the census date of the term in which the person enrolls, such as a Warranty Deed, with the person or the dependent’s parent having established and maintained domicile at that residence. (C) Marriage to a Person who has Established and Maintained Domicile in Texas. Marriage Certificate or Declaration of Registration of Informal Marriage with documentation to support that spouse has established and maintained domicile in Texas for 12 consecutive months prior to the census date of the term in which the person enrolls. (D) Ownership of a Business Entity. Documents that evidence the organization of the business in Texas that reflect the ownership interest of the person or dependent’s parent, and the customary management of the business by the person or dependent’s parent without the intention of liquidation for the foreseeable future. For examples of documentation, please visit the documentation page . You may petition for reclassification by uploading the completed Core Residency Questionnaire (pdf) and all supporting documents to the UTD Student Center prior to the first day of class for the current term. For uploading instructions please view the “Where do I upload my Core Residency Questionnaire, supporting documents and/or affidavit?” FAQ below. If you are claimed as a dependent by your parents for federal income tax purposes, then your domicile is presumed to be the same as that of your parents. To establish residency, your parents must establish domicile in Texas at least 12 months prior to census day and maintain that domicile for the 12 months immediately preceding census day. If you are claimed as a dependent by your parents for federal income tax purposes, then your domicile is presumed to be the same as that of your parents. If your parents have established domicile outside of Texas, then you are not generally eligible for resident tuition classification. This presumption may be overridden by presenting clear and convincing evidence of establishment of domicile as an independent. If you are enrolled in a Texas institution of higher education for one of the two regular terms of the academic year prior to enrollment at UT Dallas, and were classified as a resident of Texas during that year, you will be classified as a Texas resident at UT Dallas unless you provide information that indicates a change in resident status is appropriate. You are required to provide verification of your residency classification at your previous institution. Please see the residency officer at your previous school for a memo that states your resident status. Marriage to a Texas resident does not make you a Texas resident. You must meet the residency requirements to be classified as a Texas resident on your own. However, marriage to a person who has established and maintained domicile in Texas may lend support to your claim regarding your intent to establish and maintain a domicile in Texas. A temporary absence from Texas, by you or your parent (if a dependent), will not affect your (or your parent’s) ability to continue to claim that Texas is your domicile. You must have the intention to return to Texas for any absence to be considered temporary. Certain international applicants and students are legally eligible to establish and maintain a domicile in Texas and can obtain Texas residency if they meet the residency requirements as listed in this FAQ. The applicant or student must be: A person who is eligible for permanent resident status, which is defined as, “A person who has filed an I-485 application for permanent residency and has been issued a fee/filing receipt or notice of action by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) showing that his or her I-485 has been reviewed and has not been rejected”; A nonimmigrant who holds one of the types of visas (pdf) identified as eligible to domicile; A person classified by the USCIS as a Refugee, Asylee, Parolee, Conditional Permanent Resident, or Temporary Resident; A person holding temporary protected status, and spouses and children with approved petitions under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), an applicant with an approved USCIS I-360, special agricultural worker, and a person granted deferred action status by USCIS; A person who has filed an application for Cancellation of Removal and Adjustment of Status under Immigration Nationality Act 240A(b) or a Cancellation of Removal and Adjustment of Status under the Nicaraguan and Central American Relief Act (NACARA), Haitian Refugee Immigrant Fairness Act (HRIFA), or the Cuban Adjustment Act, and who has been issued a fee/filing receipt or Notice of Action by USCIS; or A person who has filed for adjustment of status to that of a person admitted as a Permanent Resident under 8 United States Code 1255, or under the “registry” program (8 United States Code 1259), or the Special Immigrant Juvenile Program (8 USC 1101(a)(27)(J)) and has been issued a fee/filing receipt or Notice of Action by USCIS. You may qualify for Texas residency regardless of immigration status if you: Graduated from a public or accredited private high school in Texas or, as an alternative to high school graduation, you received the equivalent of a high school diploma in Texas, including the successful completion of a nontraditional secondary education, and Maintained a residence continuously in Texas for: the 36 months immediately preceding the date of graduation or receipt of the diploma equivalent, as applicable; and The 12 months preceding the census date of the academic semester in which you enrolled at UT Dallas. the 36 months immediately preceding the date of graduation or receipt of the diploma equivalent, as applicable; and The 12 months preceding the census date of the academic semester in which you enrolled at UT Dallas. If you meet the above criteria, you are also required to complete a signed affidavit stating that you will apply to become a permanent resident of the U.S. as soon as you become eligible to apply. Members of the military may visit College for All Texans for information on qualifying for resident tuition. You and your family members may be entitled to a waiver of out-of-state tuition and fees.

If your classification was changed prior to the full-term census date, you are entitled to a refund of any amount paid in excess of the resident rate. If your classification is changed after the full-term census date, you will be assessed tuition and fees at the resident rate beginning with your next term of enrollment.

https://graduation.utdallas.edu/student-speeches/fall-2024-graduation/sarah-ahmed,Sarah Ahmed - Graduation | The University of Texas at Dallas,Sarah Ahmed,"Each of our experiences have taught us something unique about the world, as we’ve encountered people from diverse backgrounds, cultures and religions. These connections have reminded us that we’re all united by shared values. It’s in this unique set of experiences that we’ve found strength and resilience, shaping us into the people we are today — each one of us eager to continue learning from and serving others in our own communities. In the name of God, the most gracious, the most merciful. Class of 2024, we did it! Today is not just about ceremonies and traditions, it is about celebrating the perseverance and passion that brought us to this moment. Today is a reminder that even in the most uncertain times, we found our strength and made it through, together. I may be biased, but I think this is the most special graduation at UT Dallas. Everyone here is going to make a profound difference on others, whether that be as a future health care professional, creating informed decisions to save lives; as a teacher, shaping the minds of tomorrow; or as a leader of change, pushing boundaries in whatever field you pursue. For those of us graduating in the Healthcare Studies program, we are entering a field that is both deeply rewarding and intricately complex. Our unique major has equipped us in ways few others can, providing not only the essential foundation for pursuing advanced professional degrees but also a profound understanding of the challenges and nuances within the health care system. We’ve delved into the critical principles of patient-centered care, grappled with the complexities of health care policy, and confronted the ethical dilemmas that change lives. We’re not just armed with the basics; we’ve been immersed in real-world issues and the tangible obstacles that await us in the field. Many of us spent long hours in Dr. Kathleen Byrnes’s class, navigating exams that at times felt more like endurance tests — with answer options ranging from A through J. Yet, those demanding moments have shaped us, preparing us for the challenges and unpredictability of health care and making us stronger, more adaptable and ready for what lies ahead. Throughout my journey here at UT Dallas, I took on leadership roles, becoming an orientation leader, Student Ambassador and peer tutor, with the goal of making a difference in someone else’s life. My goal was to pay forward the impact others had on me, and to be the kind of inspiration that I once needed. Along the way, I learned the power of mentorship, the value of service and the importance of showing up for others. And I know I am not alone in this journey. Many of you have embraced opportunities to lead and support your peers, creating a ripple effect of growth here at UT Dallas. Each of our experiences have taught us something unique about the world, as we’ve encountered people from diverse backgrounds, cultures and religions. These connections have reminded us that we’re all united by shared values. It’s in this unique set of experiences that we’ve found strength and resilience, shaping us into the people we are today — each one of us eager to continue learning from and serving others in our own communities. I’ve had the privilege of interacting with many of you — my fellow graduates — and these encounters have profoundly impacted me. Each conversation, each shared experience, has taught me valuable lessons about how to do better and be better. Whether it was collaborating on projects, exchanging ideas in class or simply sharing moments of laughter or frustration, I’ve been continually inspired by your diverse perspectives and unique journeys. You’ve shown me the power of community and the importance of lifting one another up. It’s these interactions that have not only enriched my own experience, but have also deepened my appreciation for the strength and brilliance of our class. Nearly 20 years ago, I sat in the audience where many of you are sitting today, watching my dad graduate from UT Dallas with his MBA. At that young age, I couldn’t fully grasp the significance of his achievement. But now I know that I wouldn’t be here today without witnessing his dedication to learning and growth. My parents’ journey from Pakistan to the United States taught me the power of resilience and inspired me to push boundaries, proving that with determination, anything is possible. I know many of you also have someone like this in your lives — a parent, mentor or friend — who has shown you what’s possible through their own sacrifices and hard work. Today, we honor not only our own accomplishments but also the people who helped us get here. We did it, together. Most of us are fortunate enough to have people supporting us, either from right here in this room or from afar. But some of us are not so lucky. So, if nobody has told you today, I am so proud of you. I am in awe of your journey and all the obstacles you have overcome to be here. Each of you has faced your own unique challenges, and the perseverance you’ve shown is a testament to your character and commitment. As you turn the page to your next chapter, carry that spirit with you. Embrace the opportunities that lie ahead, be bold in your pursuits and never underestimate the impact you can have on those around you. Class of 2024, I have no doubt each of us will continue to shine brightly as Comets, lighting up the paths we pursue. We did it! Thank you! Sarah Ahmed is graduating with a bachelor’s in health care studies and minor in biology. During her time at UT Dallas, Ahmed served as a team leader for Freshman Orientations, vice president for the Student Ambassadors and peer tutor. She also starred in UTD’s episode of The College Tour . Ahmed graduates today as a member of Phi Kappa Phi, with Collegium V honors, major honors, and summa cum laude. She will attend medical school next fall."

Continue to make the world less scary for others. Continue to foster each other’s growth and development. Be the impact someone needs. Good evening, everyone. Welcome to the 2024 UT Dallas Naveen Jindal School of Management commencement ceremony. It is an honor to be present here, speaking in front of a crowd filled with such pure brilliance. We have all embarked on a collective journey of growth, learning and discovery. I’m sure each graduate today has a particular faculty member who had a tremendous effect on your success. For me, Professor Tom Henderson was my person. Let’s all remember to thank those special faculty who have supported us throughout this journey. Your unwavering support and belief in us have been critical to our success. I also want to thank my friends and family, especially, my parents, Zafar and Uzma Arshi. I encourage all graduates to applaud their thanks to their friends, families and support systems, as well. Before I go any further, I promise I did not ChatGPT this speech. I want to share an impactful story today that resonates with all of us here. About a month and a half ago, Ma’ruf Dallas partnered with UT Dallas students to host a field day for refugee children. Many of these children had come from places where the idea of having fun only existed in their imagination. As the event began, many of the kids were up and running right away, kicking a soccer ball, jumping in a bounce house or chatting with every volunteer they saw. However, many were hesitant and shy to even approach a single station set up for them. But interestingly, I noticed something remarkable. A child would approach one of the shy kids and nudge him to join them. Soon after, this would cause other kids to loosen up and want to join in on the fun. Or, if they weren’t nudged, they pushed themselves out of their comfort zone and attempted to enter the games. Eventually, what started as a soccer game of five versus five turned into a game of 10 versus 10. And it’s safe to say I will not be playing in the next FIFA World Cup. My ankles can testify. Despite life throwing those kids immense hardships, they were brave, fought through it, ended up having some fun and found joy. Like all those children, we are navigating a new and sometimes daunting environment. How many of us fear the next chapters in our lives? How many of us reject thoughts of stepping outside of our comfort zone? We all have had relatable moments of fear and uncertainty in our lives. Some of us recall moments when we jumped headfirst into the water and immediately started playing with the soccer ball. And to those people, I immensely applaud you. Others, like me, needed the nudge at times and stood in the back. I understand it now, though; that it’s OK to feel scared, and it’s OK to need a nudge. We are all in this together. Whatever the case may be, look at us now, conquering the endeavors that once seemed impossible, entirely wrong, and accomplishing our goals — the hardships and challenges we have tackled and persevered through to achieve the position we are sitting in. It was not easy, and there were moments when we all felt like the better option was to quit. Moments when our schedules were not lining up for work, the material looked like an entirely different language, or Quizlet was not reliable. But through the hardships, we stayed true to our goal and saw it through until the end. So, I end here today and leave everyone with a challenge. Graduates, I challenge you to persevere through the next chapters of your life. As you progress, fearful moments will reappear. There will be times when life tests you; you might lose hope, you might lose your spirit, but your character will never break. Continue to make the world less scary for others. Continue to foster each other’s growth and development. Be the impact someone needs. I challenge you to always be the person who brings someone into the soccer game, even on the days when you feel like quitting, when you don’t feel like you belong anywhere, and no one can understand your frustrations. Be the person to impact someone positively. And when no one invites you into it, be that for yourself and step boldly into the game. Because beyond the fear is either a lesson or an opportunity. It is OK to lose. Losses will come. But the losses are better than the regrets of never trying. And eventually, the victories will appear. This is not just a challenge but a responsibility we all share. Congratulations to the 2024 graduates. Thank you so much for your time.

https://graduation.utdallas.edu/student-speeches/fall-2024-graduation/sandra-cuenca,Sandra Cuenca - Graduation | The University of Texas at Dallas,Sandra Cuenca,"So today isn’t the end of the story. It’s just the beginning of the next chapter, where we take what UTD has given us and plant ourselves into new gardens. … May we continue to grow, inspire and transform the world around us. Good afternoon, fellow graduates, esteemed faculty, families and friends. Today is not just a day of celebration; it’s a testament to how far we’ve come, how much we’ve grown and how many obstacles we’ve overcome to be where we are today. We stand here not only because of our hard work but also because of the people who believed in us when we barely believed in ourselves. When I reflect on my journey at UTD, I’m reminded of something my parents always said growing up: “You can’t choose where you’re planted, but you can choose how you grow.” As a first-generation, Colombian-American student, UTD became my garden — a place where I could choose to grow into something I never even imagined was possible. I remember being 6 years old, seeing the broken health care system in Colombia and dreaming of becoming a doctor so that I could use my hands for change. Back then, I didn’t know how that dream would ever come true. But now, standing here today, I see that all of us — each in our own way — have turned our dreams into reality. This is our moment of becoming. I think we all came to UTD with our own sets of questions, dreams and insecurities. Some of us came here hoping to find a sense of belonging. Some of us were carrying the weight of family expectations, working jobs to pay bills while balancing the workload of UTD classes. Some of us, like me, spent sleepless nights in the ER, working shifts from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m., only to drag myself to campus for an early organic chemistry class. I’ve lost count of how many times I asked myself, “How am I going to make it through this one?” But that’s the thing about UTD — it’s not just about academics, it’s about resilience. We’ve learned to thrive in the chaos, to grow from our hardships and to make the impossible, possible. UTD didn’t just provide the academic foundation I needed to go to medical school — it helped me grow into a leader; it taught me how to step up and face the challenges that come with caring for others. When I first started here, I remember feeling too nervous to even raise my hand in class. The idea of speaking up, let alone taking on leadership roles, felt completely out of reach. But today, I stand here as the president of our MEDLIFE chapter, I lead two research projects, I mentor freshmen and assist in a neuro-oncology clinic. I’m doing things I never imagined myself capable of when I first arrived. UTD has given me the confidence and the tools to make an impact in whatever comes next, both in medicine and beyond. But I could not have gotten to where I am today by myself. None of us reached this milestone on our own. We were supported by faculty who challenged us, mentors who guided us and loved ones who believed in us ­— even when we did not believe in ourselves. UTD wasn’t just where I pursued my degree — it’s where I found my family. It’s where I met lifelong friends who would stand by me through every challenge, celebrate my wins and, yes, even stand by me on my wedding day. UTD is where I met my life partner. This place has been more than an institution — it’s been home. These relationships are as much a part of my education as anything I learned in the classroom, and I know that many of you have found similar connections that will last a lifetime. And so, I invite every graduate here today to take a moment to reflect on those who stood by you — whether it was a family member who worked long hours to help pay for your education, a friend who offered a listening ear when you were freaking out about that new crush or exam, or a professor who pushed you to think beyond the obvious. Let’s take this moment to say, “thank you,” because today is as much a celebration of their dedication as it is of our achievements. As we step into the unknown, we carry more than diplomas. We carry the stories, the late nights, the failures and the triumphs that have shaped us. Whether we’re entering research, clinical practice, industry, teaching or a completely different field, we have learned to face challenges head-on, to be relentless in the pursuit of our goals and to remain compassionate in everything we do. UTD taught us how to fight for what we believe in and who we can be. Working in the brain cancer clinic taught me how fragile life is and how precious time can be. In moments like those, I realized that the lessons we’ve learned at UTD go beyond critical thinking or complex problem-solving — they shape who we are and how we engage with the world. Those moments taught us to be compassionate in a world that desperately needs it. We are the ones who will heal, innovate and, most importantly, lead. So today isn’t the end of the story. It’s just the beginning of the next chapter, where we take what UTD has given us and plant ourselves into new gardens. And just like before, we will grow. We will rise to meet whatever lies ahead with the same determination and grit that got us here in the first place. Congratulations to the Class of 2024. May we continue to grow, inspire and transform the world around us. Sandra Cuenca is graduating with a Bachelor of Science in medical neuroscience. She joined UTDallas in fall 2021 and has been an active member in her community. Along with being an undergraduate research assistant in both a biomechanics laboratory and an intraoperative neuromonitoring laboratory, she was the president of the UTD MEDLIFE chapter. As president, she strengthened partnerships with impoverished countries to improve access to healthcare, education and development. She expanded the organization’s reach by coordinating volunteer trips abroad, organizing fundraisers and empowering members to make a tangible social impact. She served as a freshman mentor, guiding new students through their transition to college life, providing academic and emotional support to help them succeed. Additionally, she engaged in numerous volunteering initiatives locally and abroad. Some of these included meeting bimonthly to prepare meals for the homeless and studying abroad in Australia to learn about gender and racial violence, where she volunteered to support marginalized communities impacted by these issues.Throughout her studies, Cuenca gained hands-on medical experience working as a scribe in the ER at two hospitals and as a medical assistant and office manager in a neuro-oncology clinic. She has also been recognized on the dean’s list on multiple occasions in honor of her academic dedication. After graduation, she plans to work as an intraoperative neuromonitoring technician during her gap year while going through the medical school application cycle, with the goal of ultimately pursuing a career in surgery."

The answer is up to you. You get to write your own story. Hello professors, deans, families and guests. Many of you have traveled far to witness our success and celebrate with us. We are thankful to have you here and welcome you to UT Dallas. Graduates, today is a special day. And you all look fantastic! These are some popular hashtags on your social media and networking posts today. I often wonder, what do we really mean by “new chapter?” Or should I ask, “What should we title this new chapter?” See, for some of you here today, this is truly a new chapter. You worked hard for the past few years on your degree, and you will go on to start a great career. For others, this is maybe a page in an existing chapter. The beauty of life is that we find ourselves at different stages. I, for example, earned my undergraduate degree many years ago. Shortly after, I was hired for my first “grown-up” job, started a family and adjusted to new responsibilities. But I always had a wish to learn more. I always told everyone that once my youngest child went to kindergarten, I would go back to school for my master’s. And that’s what I did. Throughout my courses at UT Dallas, I met classmates who shared similar realities. Group meetings had to be held after 9 p.m. because that was after our children’s bedtime. I also met students who enrolled in graduate school immediately after their undergraduate degree, fully dedicated to their studies. I met many international students. By the way, UT Dallas has more than 130 countries represented! I even had classmates who lived in different cities and states. Thanks to online learning, they were able to benefit from this top-tier education. Among us, we have graduates who are on campus for the first time. But today, we are all here, in one room. Today, we all share the common experience of hard work, perseverance and the joy of reaching this milestone. Circling back to the question I asked earlier: “What will be the title of this new chapter?” The answer is up to you. You get to write your own story. And while you write your story, consider these three principles: Be compassionate : Compassion helps you understand another person’s perspective and build authentic connections. Be resilient : You’ve spent the past few years “toughing it out” through assignments, exams and research papers. For every “yes” you will get, you’re guaranteed to hear at least one “no.” Don’t let that discourage you from reaching your goals. Be gracious to yourself : Don’t be afraid to make mistakes, and don’t be afraid to learn from your mistakes — that’s how you grow. As you learn from your experiences, also recognize and celebrate the small wins. Eventually, these small wins will lead to significant achievements. Keep in mind, there isn’t a book without a cover, so I invite you to immortalize this moment. Make memories, take a picture or two, congratulate the person next to you, and network with fellow graduates. Because, Comets, regardless of where we are in life, this is today’s chapter. I would like to end by leaving you with two hashtags for your social media posts: #todayschapter and #ForeverComets.  Congratulations! Aisha Conde Dibaki is graduating with a master’s in supply chain management. Originally from Ivory Coast, Dibaki embarked on her journey to the United States many years ago to pursue her undergraduate studies. After earning a bachelor’s in marketing, she began her professional career in client services, where she honed her skills in communication and relationship-building. She then transitioned into the nonprofit sector, focusing on fundraising for schools and universities. In 2021, Dibaki joined UT Dallas as a staff member in the Office of Development and Alumni Relations, where she made significant contributions before becoming a student herself. Dibaki currently serves as associate director of UT Dallas Alumni, where she is dedicated to fostering connections and enhancing the alumni experience."

We have gained so much more than academic knowledge: we have gained resilience, adaptability and confidence that will carry us forward. Good afternoon, faculty, staff, friends, families and graduating Class of 2024! I am incredibly honored and humbled to be in front of you all. We are here today to celebrate our accomplishments and the path we have taken to get to this moment. Some of us have returned after some time away, while others are finishing their undergraduate journeys for the first time. After seven years in the industry, I felt stuck, unsure of my next step or the right path forward. In that moment of uncertainty, I turned to education, trusting it to help me find clarity and purpose. We all have a version of this story, and we are all here because we believed that this journey was worth taking. We chose to be here, to invest in our education and to embrace a spirit of curiosity. Education doesn’t follow a set path, and we are examples of that. In our programs, we learned a lot about accounting, finance and analytics. One thing I did not expect to learn was the ability to make decisions and be confident in them. As we step into the unknown, we will be required to make many important decisions that may seem overwhelming. We will question and needlessly worry about making the “perfect” decisions. Deepak Chopra once said, “There is no right or wrong, only a series of possibilities that shift with each thought, feeling and action that you experience.” Each choice we make opens new opportunities and brings its own lessons. Instead of waiting or tormenting between the right and wrong choice, trust the foundation you have built here. Our education and commitment to learning have equipped us with the confidence and trust in ourselves to make thoughtful decisions. Whether we completed our degrees in the traditional timeframe or took a more winding path, we all have proven that the spirit of learning has no boundaries. We have gained so much more than academic knowledge: we have gained resilience, adaptability and confidence that will carry us forward. We could not have done it alone. Watching my sister walk on this very stage two years ago encouraged me to change the course of my life. Look around this auditorium — it is filled with the people who have supported us along the way. Let’s take a moment and wave to those who made this journey possible for you. Hi, Mom! Hi, Dad! Now, take a moment and congratulate yourself on this monumental achievement. Only you can understand the value of the sacrifices you have made to get here. Congratulations, Class of 2024! We have the power to decide our futures, and I am excited to see where each path will lead. Riju Humagain is graduating with an MBA. She joined UT Dallas after earning her bachelor’s degree from UT Austin and building a remarkable career at Amazon, where she led operations teams for seven years. Graduating with distinction and serving as a UTD Forté ambassador, Humagain has exemplified leadership and dedication throughout her MBA journey. This summer, she contributed to a pharmaceutical company’s digital transformation during her internship with Cognizant, where she plans to continue her career after graduation."

You owe it to yourself — the one who persevered and brought you to this day — to continue striving for and building a life you are proud of. Good afternoon fellow EPPS graduates! It is an incredible honor to stand before you all today as we celebrate one of the most significant milestones of our lives — graduating college. My journey to this moment has been anything but ordinary. I somehow managed to stretch a four-year degree into 6 ½ years. Some might call this “dedication to maximizing the college experience.” Others will more accurately call it “poor time management.” When I first set foot on this campus as an 18-year-old, my future seemed clear and well-lit. I had just graduated high school with honors and was blessed to have my college completely paid for by family. To achieve my goal of becoming a lawyer, all I had to do was focus on school. That is exactly opposite of what I did. After 16 weeks of intense “networking” (or, let’s be honest, too much partying), I ended my first semester of college on academic probation with a .08 GPA. Yep, you heard that right: point-zero-eight. I shook it off but made no changes to my priorities. For the next year, I failed to earn a GPA above 2.0, despite even moving back home to attend the local university for support. At this point, graduating from UTD — or anywhere for that matter — felt like it was not in the cards for me. Yet, I kept enrolling. In March 2020, my grades were looking great, and due to the pandemic, I no longer had in-person classes or a fun cocktail waitress job, one of the few things I enjoyed about living in my small hometown as an extrovert. I took this as a sign, secured a temporary position working at a drugstore and moved back to Dallas. That May, I ended my first of many semesters in good academic standing. In July 2020, looking for job stability and experience in the criminal justice system, I made a life-changing decision to become a county jailer, where I would discover my strong passion for criminology. With the guidance and support of my wonderful academic advisor, I was able to transfer back to UTD as a criminology major in the summer of 2021. Juggling a difficult profession and school, I fought relentlessly for today. I made it, and so did you. If there’s one takeaway from my story, it’s this: anything is possible when you refuse to give up on yourself . My presence here is a testament to that truth. My journey through adversity is not unique. All of us have faced obstacles on the path to walking across this prestigious stage. I invite you to take a moment, think back on those challenges and thank yourself for never giving up on you. Yes, we owe gratitude to those who supported us — family, friends, pets, school faculty — but ultimately, it was you who brought yourself here. Remember, as you soon walk out of this lecture hall into your future as a college graduate, that you will always be the person who gets yourself there. You will always have yourself, and that is enough. You are enough. You owe it to yourself — the one who persevered and brought you to this day — to continue striving for and building a life you are proud of. Thank you, and congratulations on this outstanding accomplishment, fall Class of 2024! Go Comets! Madilynn Pinson is graduating with a bachelor’s in criminology, and her journey is one of resilience, determination and commitment. Since 2020, Pinson has been building her professional experience with the Dallas County Sheriff’s Department, where she has found and pursued her passion for criminology. Through this role, she earned her Texas Commission on Law Enforcement certification, a significant milestone as she pursues a career dedicated to justice and community safety. Balancing her studies with the responsibilities of a working professional, Pinson has shown exceptional dedication, setting an inspiring example of what young professionals can accomplish when they follow their passion with purpose."

It’s these moments of stepping up — often when no one else wanted to — that have shaped us into the individuals we are today. Good morning, faculty, family, friends and fellow graduates. They say college is where you find yourself. Well, I think we all found ourselves … trying to survive Texas heat, parking woes and a mountain of last-minute assignments. But we made it! We’re here today, not just as individuals, but as a united Class of 2024, ready to take on whatever the world throws our way. Looking around, it’s clear that each one of us has travelled a unique path to be here. Irrespective of the paths, we all brought our own stories, challenges and triumphs, and today we take on the world together as the class of 2024. Adapting to college life felt like learning a new dance — sometimes we stumbled, sometimes we missed a beat, but we always got back up and kept moving. We tried our best to balance classes, internships, projects and a social life (whatever was left of it). We’ve all been there — juggling late-night study sessions, group projects where someone mysteriously went missing , and let’s not forget the countless cups of coffee that got us through it all. I would take coffee in an IV bag if I could. At this point, we’ve all become leaders in our own right. Whether it was taking charge of a group project, engaging with a student organization, or stepping up to help a friend, each of us has displayed resilience and leadership throughout our time here. It’s these moments of stepping up — often when no one else wanted to — that have shaped us into the individuals we are today. So, let’s give ourselves a round of applause because we’ve earned it. College has been a melting pot of cultures, experiences and, yes, even food. Who here hasn’t at some point tried to convince their friends that their native cuisine is the best? From potlucks to dance nights, we’ve had the chance to learn about each other’s traditions, tastes and tunes. The cultural exchange has been as rich as our coursework (if not richer), and we’ve all become a bit more worldly along the way. We’ve had professors who challenged us, courses that pushed us to our limits and projects that tested our patience (and maybe our friendships, too). But beyond the textbooks and assignments, we learned something invaluable — how to think critically, solve problems creatively and bounce back from failure. Remember that group project where everything seemed to go wrong and you were sure you were doomed? Yet, somehow, you pulled it together at the last minute, and it turned out all right. That’s real-world training right there! But let’s be honest — not one of us got here alone. Behind every graduate is a support system that deserves a standing ovation. To our families: you’ve been our rock, our cheerleaders and sometimes our unofficial life coaches. Mom and Dad, thank you for believing in me, especially when I didn’t believe in myself. Your faith in me has been my greatest strength. To our friends and mentors: thank you for reminding us of our worth, inspiring us to dream big and making this journey unforgettable. Today is your celebration, too. As we stand on the edge of this new chapter, there’s a mix of excitement and uncertainty. But if there’s one thing we’ve learned, it’s that we are ready for anything. Not because we have all the answers (we certainly don’t), but because we’ve been equipped with the tools, courage and resilience to face whatever comes next. We’ve learned how to adapt, how to pivot and, most importantly, how to keep going when things don’t go as planned. So, here’s to us. May we face every challenge with determination, meet every setback with resilience and greet every success with humility. Let’s go out there, make our mark and — most importantly — let’s have fun while doing it. Congratulations, Class of 2024! The world is waiting for us, and I have no doubt we’re ready to make it better. Thank you, and lets Whoosh to our bright future! Sunyana Rongali joined UT Dallas as an exchange student from O.P.

After all, the beauty of a comet lies in the trail that it leaves behind. Esteemed faculty, mentors, proud families and fellow graduates, it is my honor to stand before you today and represent this graduating class as we celebrate our success. A few years ago, when I traveled across the country to attend UTD without even a campus visit, I never would have imagined I’d be standing here today. It was a risky decision, but I’m grateful I made it. As you prepare to cross the stage today, I hope that you acknowledge not only your growth over the past few years but also the family, friends and mentors who fostered that growth. In my case, I know I wouldn’t be here without the boundless support of my family. But there are others who played a role. Not long ago, I was told to reconsider a career in science, but my friends and mentors at the De Nisco Lab, namely Dr. Nicole De Nisco and Dr. Namrata Sawant, helped mold me into the scientist I am today. I grew significantly during my time here, and I’m sure you have as well. My fellow graduates, let’s reflect on the hardships we surmounted to reach this point — not as an empty exercise or an excuse to wallow in our suffering — but to remind ourselves that we will face hardships, and we will overcome them. For example, I’m sure I’m not the only one in this audience with loved ones we expected to be in this room with us today, who are instead cheering us on from above. For me, this past year has been especially challenging, after unexpectedly losing two of my grandparents, whose blessings have taken me so far. Today is a day not only to celebrate ourselves, but to thank our loved ones for making us who we are, and to remind ourselves that those who raised us, loved us and guided us, will have authorship in our successes, today and always. And in our success, may the ones not here today live forever, as with their blessings, we march forward. With that in mind, I want to take a brief moment to honor my old roommate and our fellow Comet, Aryan Raghunath Orampati, who is no longer here with us. He graduated just this past spring, and I hope with this message, I can make sure he is remembered as the thoughtful, cheerful, friendly soul that he was and thank him for the positive impact he had on me during my time at UT Dallas. As you’ve made your way through many years of education, I’m sure you’ve all heard the word “leader” used a lot — often as an expectation placed on you. Two years ago, when I took the class Intro to Public Service, we had an open discussion with the prompt, “What is a leader?” This turned out to be one of the most difficult, thought-provoking questions I encountered during my college career, and that includes Organic Chemistry I. Maybe not OCHEM II, though. But anyway, I took this question home and thought about it. Asking myself, “What is a leader?” I sometimes pictured a great orator before a podium, a quarterback in the huddle or the captain of a ship. I couldn’t form a clear idea of what the word meant, and a simple online search would give a vague, broad set of personality traits, all of which rang true. But when people use the term “born leader,” what does that make everyone else? How do we know if we’re born leaders? And if we’re not lucky enough to be born leaders, does that automatically make us followers? Today, I will share with you my understanding of this question. Just delivering a speech does not necessarily make someone a leader. I say this as I put everyone here in an unskippable cutscene on one the most important days of their lives. There are many contexts and archetypes of the word “leader,” but a key aspect, at least when addressing such a talented group, lies in taking initiative. If a ship is sinking, we think of the leader as the captain who steers the ship. But what about the person who rushes to plug the hole? What about the person who cuts the anchors loose? What about the person who motivates those around them to remain hopeful? Are they not leaders? There was a moment, a moment of crisis, when each member of the crew could step up into a new role; and because each of them did — because each of them led — the ship floats. Through taking initiative, no matter our backgrounds, skillsets or personalities, we all have equal opportunities to be leaders. Looking into the audience, even though many of us share the same degrees, we represent a broad range of cultures, backgrounds and experiences. No two paths in this room are exactly the same, but they all crossed here. Being able to learn from all of you made my time at UT Dallas deeply meaningful and emphasized the importance of diversity. There are countless fields in the real world that need leaders, and just in this room we have the variety of talents, personalities, experiences and skills to provide them. As you step out into the world with your degrees, don’t hesitate to be the problem-solver — take the wheel, cut the anchor, plug the hole, inspire change around you. This is how the ship floats, and this is how leaders are made. And, as most of us embark from campus for one of the last times, may the skills and knowledge we acquired over our time here at UT Dallas translate from the classroom to the real world. Our reputation as Comets relies on us pushing the boundaries of our fields and deciding to become leaders, as the alumni before us have. After all, the beauty of a comet lies in the trail that it leaves behind. My final message to the many leaders before me — I kindly request: take care of yourselves, take care of each other and take care of your communities. Swami Sadanala is originally from New Jersey and graduates today with a bachelor’s in healthcare studies with both major honors and Collegium V honors. As an undergraduate researcher on campus, he delivered a podium presentation at the American Urological Association and won a first-place presentation award at a state conference. He served as a leader on campus in the club Hindu YUVA and is a frequent volunteer at his temple. He plans to follow his passion for research through new projects."

Each and every one of you has done great things, and we will all continue to do them as alumni of The University of Texas at Dallas. Hello to everyone graduating, the people supporting us, and all the faculty and staff who have helped us get here. I would like to take a moment to acknowledge how much time and effort we all have put into reaching this milestone and all the amazing work we have done to get us to graduation day. We have all grown and changed so much since our first days here at UT Dallas. I would like to tell you a bit about myself, about my experience here at UTD, and then share a few words of encouragement as we continue onward. Unlike many of you, I am not from Texas. I lived in West Virginia for most of my life. But four years ago I moved to Austin to live with my grandmother. I attended Austin Community College while I saved money — always hoping to transfer to some fancy art school. The longer I attended community college, the more I understood that a fancy art school was not a place I wanted to go. I needed a place that would give me a much more well-rounded and less-specialized education. I looked at all the schools around the country hoping to find the right one — and I found it in UT Dallas. In 2022, I moved to Richardson and am so glad I did. The friends I’ve made at UTD were all a bit surprised to learn that I applied to be today’s student speaker. I suffer from anxiety. Anxiety so bad that it was often debilitating when it came to any sort of public presentation or performance. While I still struggle with it, my time here at UT Dallas has been transformative. I have changed in ways I didn’t previously think possible. I feel encouraged when presenting in front of my peers and, after much practice, I can now say that I feel much more capable of addressing an audience — one just like you! I’m still anxious — don’t get me wrong — but I breathe through it and try not to let the anxiety control me. I recently saw the movie “The Wild Robot.” It’s a story about love and family, and about the beauty of change and how wonderful it is to truly be alive. The film follows Roz, a robot, who is mistakenly delivered to a wild place not meant for someone like her. While watching the film, I found myself comparing my time here at UT Dallas to Roz’s experience in her new and wild place. Just as Roz struggled in adapting to her new environment, I struggled with adapting to my new life at UTD, finding myself without any of my family close by to support me for the first time in my life. I want to acknowledge, however, one professor who helped me along the way. Dr. Christine Veras’ classes were where I really felt empowered to think for myself and think outside the box. I gained perspective on not only how animation is created, but also how it can alter society and widespread beliefs. Dr. Veras helped me through a time of great change. Change is an important aspect of all of our lives. We are all in a near constant state of change. We are changed by the people around us, changed by what we learn, changed by where we live, and changed by the decisions we make. We chose to come to this school, we chose our majors and now, because of those choices, we are college graduates! As you leave UT Dallas, I hope that each of you will welcome and even embrace the change coming for us all. We will surely all make mistakes, but we will learn from them and go on to do great things. Now, that may be an intimidating ask — doing great things. But I assure you all, we do great things every day. “The Wild Robot” taught me that existing, in and of itself, is great. Even the smallest things can be great, can inspire others and can change someone or something for the better. Each and every one of you has done great things, and we will all continue to do them as alumni of The University of Texas at Dallas. Trinity Sencindiver is graduating today magna cum laude with a bachelor’s in arts, technology and emerging communications, with a concentration in animation and games. She has focused her studies on preproduction for animation and games, with a passion for bringing diverse stories to the animation world. Sencindiver has contributed to the preproduction of the animated short film “Kraken’s Tooth” and the game “GraveBound,” both of which are being produced by the Harry W. Bass Jr. School of Arts, Humanities, and Technology. She is also the writer and illustrator of “Kitten Buddies,” her capstone project. Over the past two and a half years, Trinity has served as a student assistant for the Bass School, earning dean’s list recognition along the way. After graduation, she will join the Disney College Program."

Hidden inside something you didn’t plan for might be the opportunity that unlocks your brightest future. Good morning fellow graduates, faculty, friends and family. Welcome, and thank you for taking time out of your day to attend this celebration. I’d like to begin by speaking directly to my fellow graduates. Today we are here to celebrate you. Today we celebrate the grit, perseverance and strong will that led you here. Believe me, I know that getting to graduation was not an easy task. I know over the last four years you experienced many tears, sleepless nights and nightmarish midterms. So be proud of yourself. Shout it from the rooftops, call your relatives, wear your graduation gown to the supermarket if you want to. Be proud. After all, we not only earned a diploma proving our commitment to higher education, but we also experienced significant growth in every aspect of our lives. No matter how different that growth might look to each of us, and no matter how we might continue to grow apart, in many ways we grew together. We grew because of shared experiences to which we can all relate. I’m sure most of us relate to circling the parking lot like a hawk, hoping a spot will appear out of thin air (ideally with the correct permit color). How about wondering if Tobor actually ever makes it across the crosswalk to its destination. (I’ve still never seen that happen.) What about slipping on the ice outside of McDermott Library after a freeze? Picking up your things and heading inside to stand awkwardly outside of a study room, waiting for it to free up? And lastly, we all probably can relate to the frantic sprint across campus when you’re running late. The culprit: forgetting to buy a blue exam book from the bookstore with quarters found at the bottom of your bag. Cherish these moments and hold them deep and close to your heart. After all, while some of us may return to UTD to pursue other ventures, for many this may be one of the last times you set foot on campus. A door is closing behind us, but in front of us, many more will open. Although I love the doors a diploma opens for me, I love the experiences I’ve had here even more. It’s crazy to think that if I had never applied to UTD I would not be who I am today. I like to think the butterfly effect is responsible for that: so many tiny, seemingly insignificant moments that led me right here, to this one. For example, if I hadn’t decided to spontaneously apply as a transfer student, I wouldn’t have signed up for a Women in Management course. And then I wouldn’t have sat next to a girl that would become one of my best friends, and she wouldn’t have encouraged me to become a teacher. I would have never sat in AJ Crowell’s office to fill out the Teacher Development Center paperwork. I would never have discovered my passion for teaching. I could go on and on about how my life changed since taking my first step on campus. I say all of this to encourage you to think about the decisions that led you to this day, and where those small moments might lead you tomorrow. I want to leave you with one more note. I know I’ve already encouraged you to think about your journey and find those special moments you can cherish, but I also want to acknowledge the fact that many of the twists and turns in my own journey were uncertain and unexpected. When we hear these two words, uncertain and unexpected, we often think of them as negative things. In our college careers, we are told over and over about how we need to have a plan, we need to think it through, and we need to know exactly when and where the light at the end of the tunnel will be. However, my transfer to UTD was unexpected. I applied on the very last day of the deadline. My future was uncertain; I had no backup plan. And it turned out to be the best decision I ever made. My student teaching placement was unexpected. I told myself I never wanted to teach younger grades, and I was uncertain when I was placed in a second-grade classroom. Instead of feeling relief and joy about finding a placement, I was scared. But standing here now, with only three days left to teach in that classroom, I couldn’t be happier with how I grew into my role as a second-grade teacher. Instead of letting fear hold you back, embrace the unexpected, the uncertain and the unconventional. Hidden inside something you didn’t plan for might be the opportunity that unlocks your brightest future. Thank you for listening, and congratulations, fellow graduates! Sydney Turk is graduating with a bachelor’s in interdisciplinary studies with foundations in education and behavioral science, and a concentration in teaching. She is pursuing her early childhood through sixth-grade teaching certification through UT Dallas’ Teacher Development Center. She also graduates summa cum laude and with interdisciplinary major honors. She will begin her first semester as a first-grade, dual-language teacher for Wylie ISD in January."

https://graduation.utdallas.edu/student-speeches/fall-2024-graduation/eddie-villarreal,Eddie Villarreal - Graduation | The University of Texas at Dallas,Eddie Villarreal,"While our individual actions may not end world issues, we are capable of changing someone’s world. Find the spot where you can give back. Rise through adversity as you have before and be the change you want to see. Fellow Comets, friends and family, thank you for joining us. To my peers, congratulations on achieving this milestone. I don’t know about y’all, but there were many sleepless nights working on projects when I was uncertain that I would make it to graduation. A year ago, I returned to my elementary school and spoke with a first-grade class about my journey to becoming an engineer. They asked questions like, “How long would it take to build a skateboard that can fly?” and “Do you know where I left my backpack?” One question that stuck with me was, “How do you become an engineer?” I wanted to tell them that with a number of core courses, a sprinkle of electives and dependence on caffeine, they too could one day call themselves engineers. However, I wondered, what truly makes any of us engineers? I’ve come to believe that to be an engineer you must do three things. First, you must challenge the paradigm. We have chosen to enter a field leading one of the largest technical revolutions in history. Only 20 years ago, people needed a paper map to navigate a new city, and now you can find the fastest route to any destination in the blink of an eye. Second, you must be persistent. Solutions rarely present themselves after a quick brainstorming session or even an all-nighter. Your persistence allows you to create the change the world needs. And third, you must be confident. As you begin your journey, you will meet many incredible individuals who have had amazing experiences and accomplished great things. It’s easy to doubt your background, but I urge you to remember that you, too, are extraordinary people who have done remarkable things. What you have achieved was no mistake, and where you land is no accident. Your persistence and dedication have driven you. As students, we followed unique paths. Maybe you worked a part-time job, studying between class and work. Perhaps you devoted time to a student organization, persuading others to attend that general body meeting with promises of pizza and snacks. You may have woken up early to go to the gym or aimed for a full eight hours of sleep. Whatever your route, I am proud of you for following it. While it is easy to remember your own efforts, I ask that you remember those who supported you. Our parents who listened to us gripe about the difficulties of centering a div in a webpage, our siblings who listened to us practice our presentations, our friends who were ready to celebrate or offer condolences when exam scores came out, and our professors who pushed our minds to their limits and then pushed some more. Our degrees not only justify our struggles, but they also will benefit the community around us. As engineers, it is our job to solve problems, and as graduates, it is our responsibility to give back. While our individual actions may not end world issues, we are capable of changing someone’s world. Find the spot where you can give back. Rise through adversity as you have before and be the change you want to see. As we part paths, I wish you the best of luck. May you be filled with wonder, innovation and the unwavering belief that you can change the world one problem at a time. Eddie Villarreal is graduating with a master’s degree in software engineering.

Remember, you have the power to inspire hope and ignite possibility in others. Leave a legacy greater than just your achievements. Thank you, Dr. Michal Biewer and Dean David Hyndman. Before I begin, I’d like to acknowledge all the faculty and staff in the School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics and the wider University. Your hard work and dedication year after year are the foundation of our success, and your commitment to our growth has shaped both our knowledge and our character, and for that, we are deeply grateful. I also want to take a moment to thank all the family and friends who have supported us throughout this journey. To our siblings, partners, loved ones, friends and parents: your encouragement, patience and unwavering belief in us have been our greatest source of strength. Today is as much your triumph as it is ours. Thank you for everything. It’s an honor to be here today. I see before me many of the brightest and kindest people I will ever know, and as I look out here today, I am reminded of the words of the actress Bae Doona. “Our lives are not our own. From womb to tomb, we are bound to others. And by each choice, and every kindness, we birth our future.” Here at UTD, we know all too well the connection between choices and struggle and triumph. For many of us, our journey here began in a time of uncertainty a few short years ago. Despite this, we are here today because we made a choice — we chose to confront adversity, to continue forward despite our challenges. And, to our surprise, it was in our struggle that we discovered something beautiful: that our challenges, our hardships, our moments of brilliance and kindness —these are ours, shared and celebrated and felt in so many ways, far beyond ourselves. “Our lives and our choices,” said Tom Hanks, “are like quantum trajectories, understood moment to moment. But in every moment, at every intersection, they suggest a new potential and direction.” Four years ago, a neurological injury left me struggling to walk. My immune system had attacked my spinal cord, leaving me with numbness, weakness and extreme pain in my arms, my hands and my legs. For nearly a year, I struggled to do anything without support, and I spent months in bed trying to come to terms with my fate and my future. Those were difficult times. But in those dark moments, words of hope hung in my mind: “They who would learn to fly one day, must first learn to walk and run and jump and climb and dance; one cannot fly into flying,” said Friedrich Nietzsche. That hope, that there was hope, is what drove me from doctor to doctor, praying that if I put in the work, I could live a better life. That hope that I could heal and grow, is what drove me month after month to work to grow stronger. And that hope, that I could one day learn to fly, that I could reclaim purpose and find meaning with my life, that hope is what brought me to UTD, and it is this hope, this belief, in ourselves and our future; this is why we are all seated here today. Here I learned to walk again. And to run to my classes for which I was so frequently late. And here we learned to jump at opportunities, and climb ever higher in our disciplines, and at last to dance — across the ballads of statistical methods and biology, the intersections of the arts and business, of science and civic responsibility. I and we and all of us together have done so many incredible and beautiful and meaningful things. Now, with everything we have learned and achieved and experienced here together, we take flight. We step out into a world of unparalleled possibility and uncertainty. The next 100 years may see humanity reach out to the stars, cure disease, harness the power of a sun and answer many of life’s great mysteries. But we must be ready to confront the challenges of our time. We must be prepared to move forward with strength, courage and kindness. And as we begin this next chapter of our lives, I want to urge each of you to carry forward four principles that will guide you and ground you in all your endeavors. Seize Opportunity — As we step into tomorrow, let us honor that each of us holds the potential to shape the world around us. Remember, it is always up to you to take the first step, and you owe it to yourself to follow it with a second. Use what you’ve gained here. Pursue Brilliance with Humility — Never lose sight that our successes are meaningful because they serve something greater than ourselves. Let your achievements serve as steppingstones for others, and remember that the most profound brilliance is often revealed in the quiet moments of honest exchange and shared contemplation. Starve the ego, feed the soul. Strive To Illuminate — Be the light that guides others. Take your talents, your drive and your heart and use them to illuminate the path for those who follow. Remember, you have the power to inspire hope and ignite possibility in others. Leave a legacy greater than just your achievements; and, Lead With Virtue — Your principles define you; lean on them during dark times and you will see the light you bring to the world reflected back by those you inspire. True leadership is measured not by power or by accolade, but by the integrity and compassion you bring to every action and every decision. Graduates, here we have laid our foundation for a life of purpose. We carry our principles forward with us, and we must recognize that what we hold is far more valuable than our individual aspirations — we are called to action. We must honor our boundless potential, we must foster the deep connections and friendships we have forged here, and we must never cease to see the beauty and hope we find reflected back in the eyes of each other. We are cosmic in our ambition, brilliant, in so many ways, and bound — bound to our beliefs in a better world; to our lives as they intersect and recombine; and to each other, to the potential and virtue each of us holds. We are capable of so much, and we are driven to do more. And let us never forget that it was here — it was here — that we were pulled and here we pulled together. Here at UTD our trajectories, defined as they are by our peers and our struggles and our many triumphs, present in us the opportunity of a lifetime. Here and now and forever forward, we choose to live and do with the greatness and goodness of ourselves and our belief in each other. Because we are Comets, and our futures are as bright and as high and as great as the sky we illuminate. That future is here now, Comets, and it is ours. Thank you all for being here. Thank you to our families and the administration, and, graduates, congratulations!

The evidence must justify the claim both clearly and convincingly. Continuing Education: A person who was enrolled in an institution of higher learning for any part of the previous state fiscal year.

Residence: A person’s home or other dwelling place; where a person resides.

For example, a graduate student who is required to take 9 credit hours to be full-time enrolled would need at least 6 credit hours of face-to-face coursework.

https://registrar.utdallas.edu/legislative-policies/3peat,Texas Three Course Repeat Rule - UTD Registrar,Texas Three Course Repeat Rule,An undergraduate student is limited to three grade-bearing enrollment attempts for any specific class. A student attempting the same class for the third time will be charged a penalty fee equivalent to the out-of-state tuition for the same number of semester credit hours. This is due to state legislation eliminating funding to higher education for courses that are attempted three or more times. Courses cross-listed under more than one course prefix are considered the same course.

https://registrar.utdallas.edu/legislative-policies/6-withdrawal,Texas 6-Withdrawals Rule - UTD Registrar,Texas 6-Withdrawals Rule,"Please Note: For Spring 2020, Summer 2020, Fall 2020, Spring 2021 and Summer 2021 undergraduate course withdrawals will not count towards a student’s 6-withdrawal limit. Texas Senate Bill no. 1231 mandates that a student who enrolls in a Texas public institution as a first-time freshman in fall 2007 or later, not be allowed to withdraw from more than six courses over his or her entire undergraduate career including all courses taken at any Texas public institution of higher education. UT Dallas uses the following distinctions when canceling course registration: Drop — officially canceling registration for a class prior to Census Day; no record of the student’s enrollment in the class remains on the transcript. Withdrawal — officially canceling registration for a class after Census Day; a permanent record of the course attempt remains on the student’s transcript. Census Day — the day that official enrollment figures are captured for state reporting each semester (see Academic Calendar for dates). Complete university withdrawal — officially canceling all registration. The 6-Withdrawals rule applies only to courses from which a student withdraws after Census Day. If you are subject to this legislation and withdraw from a course, the determination of whether the withdrawal is for academic or non-academic reasons will impact your academic career. Any course(s) withdrawn at another Texas public institution that meets this act’s criteria will also count against the 6-Withdrawals limitation. Please review the information in the undergraduate catalog concerning non-academic withdrawals . Academic withdrawals — any withdrawal during the withdrawal period that is not petitioned or a petitioned withdrawal that does not have the committee’s approval as a non-academic withdrawal. All academic withdrawals at UT Dallas, noted as W, WL, WP or WF on the transcript, will count towards the 6-Withdrawals limitation. The count also includes withdrawal grades on courses from other Texas public institutions of higher education. Students will be notified of their status of withdrawals prior to the Census Day of each full-term semester. UT Dallas recognizes courses with separate lecture and lab/discussion/recitation sections listed as co-requisites which will be treated as a single course for purposes of the limitation. As always, students may drop classes without penalty prior to the 12th class day (Census Day) in any semester. Non-academic withdrawals are exempt from counting toward the 6-Withdrawals rule. Non-academic withdrawals include withdrawals due to severe illness, death, military duty, work schedule conflict, or good cause. On UT Dallas transcripts, these are noted as WC, WD, WI, WM, and WW. The count excludes complete withdrawal from all classes for a semester, or complete withdrawal from the university, which is noted as WU on the transcript. The count excludes withdrawals from zero-hour courses and developmental courses. The count also excludes withdrawals from independent or private Texas institutions, out-of-state institutions, and out of country institutions. Withdrawals from college level courses taken as dual-credit prior to high school graduation are not counted. You will not be able to withdraw from the course and you will receive a final grade in the course. The University has an appeal process by which students can request exemption for a specific withdrawal. Students should contact the Director of Academic Advising for more information."
