No pass, ID, payment, or fare is required for Comet Cruiser (883 buses). Be sure to stand at the bus stop. The buses cannot stop anywhere except at the bus stop. Once the bus leaves the bus stop, it cannot stop again so you need to be at their stop early, and ready to board. Avoid jaywalking to bus stops. Only cross roadways at pedestrian crosswalks to access bus stops (especially important for those living at 7421 at Frankford, and the Frankford Estates!). The bus times listed on the website are DEPARTURE times, not arrival times. Students should be at their stop ~5 minutes early to avoid missing their bus.

The scam artists send fraudulent checks for more than the salary and ask the employee to send the extra cash to a third party. The employee then suffers the loss. Scam artists also target students who need housing. They will list an address for a rental property, which is advertised at a low price, and tell the victim to ""drive by and take a look."" In reality, the scam artist has no right to be renting the location. Victims are asked to send a deposit to hold the rental property, and the deposit is lost forever.

If you would like to Request to Defer your Admission to a later term: Log into your Galaxy account using your Net ID and password Go to Orion and select the Admission Forms option in the Applicant Center Within the Admissions Forms section, select the ""Request Graduate Deferment"" or ""Request Undergraduate Deferment"" option Fill out and submit the form by Census Day Notify the ISSO through iComet as soon as you know you will not be arriving for the start of the semester. Submit the 'Deferral I-20 Request' eForm in iComet to notify ISSO and request your updated I-20. Important: Enrolled students will need to drop their classes prior to the first day of class to be eligible to defer. To drop/withdraw from a course, please follow the instructions at: http://registrar.utdallas.edu/registration/ For questions regarding your deferment of admission request, please contact the Office of Admission and Enrollment at admission@utdallas.edu.

The ISSO will not change the program start date on the I-20 for F-1 visa interview appointments as this falls in line with the UT Dallas academic calendar and the dates we have informed the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that school starts. Although Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at the U.S. airport might permit students to enter past the program start date, it is our experience that late-arriving students have a stressful time settling in and meeting all the pre-registration requirements (mandatory TB test, orientations, housing, etc). The inability to meet all these requirements may jeopardize a student's F-1 or J-1 visa status. The letter does not guarantee entry. It simply reduces the likelihood that late arriving students will be turned away at the U.S. Port of Entry. However, being denied entry remains a risk. If late arriving students are turned away, it is generally their responsibility to pay the cost to return to their home country."

If an unpaid internship is not covered by an authorization such as CPT or OPT, F-1 students are risking their immigration status. You cannot continue CPT after your program completion date.

If you use this RCL, you will be required to carry a standard full-time course load in the next long semester, unless approved for reduced enrollment by the ISSO based on another reason, such as a documented medical illness. For example, if you use the RCL due to CPT for fall, then you must take standard full-time course load in spring. CPT lasts at least 11 weeks CPT is full-time (more than 20 hours per week) You did not use this option in the previous long semester. You must be enrolled in a UTD course for the entire semester. If your CPT course lasts the full session, then you can maintain your F-1 status by only enrolling in the CPT course. If the CPT course is an 8-week course, then you must enroll in at least one additional course in that takes place in the alternate 8-week session or lasts for the full semester. Students are typically not eligible for CPT (and accompanying Reduced Course Load) in first semester of new major/program or immediately after OPT. Per university policy, students must have an established GPA and be in good academic standing in the program that the internship applies to. Your academic program may have additional enrollment requirements.Check with your academic advisor."

https://isso.utdallas.edu/employment-and-internships/is-employment/cpt,Curricular Practical Training - International Students and Scholars Office | The University of Texas at Dallas,CPT Frequently Asked Questions,"TA and RA positions typically have restrictions on pursuing other outside employment. You may refer to the UTD Human Resources TA/ RA Policy . Refer to your academic department/ supervisor for more information. No. CPT authorization is required for F-1 students even if the internship is unpaid. Students who engage in unpaid activities that would constitute 'employment' under labor laws are considered 'employed.' If an unpaid internship is not covered by an authorization such as CPT or OPT, F-1 students are risking their immigration status. In general, students will only be granted one CPT authorization for one employer per semester. However, if you lose your CPT due to no fault of your own, then your academic department has the discretion to approve a second CPT. If your GPA drops below good standing, your CPT will be cancelled. You  must maintain good academic standing throughout your CPT experience. If you are approved for full-time CPT (more than 20 hours per week), then working 40 hours or more per week is not a violation of your immigration status. The immigration regulations do not limit students on CPT to a maximum number of hours per week. However, keep in mind that just as there are immigration regulations, there are labor laws and regulations that employers must follow. There may be labor laws that affect how many hours you may work and how you should be compensated. Additionally, please be aware of UTD Human Resources Quantity of Work Policy , which states: A student's combined employment and semester credit hours load may not exceed forty (40) hours per week. Please refer to the linked policies of UTD's campus career centers pertaining to F-1 students participating in CPT and on-campus work simultaneously: Students cannot hold both an on-campus job and a Curricular Practical Training (CPT) internship simultaneously. Before starting a CPT internship, students must receive authorization and end their on-campus employment. Can I work on both an internship and a RA/TA or on-campus job at the same time or in the same semester? JSOM policy is that you must only have one work experience per semester. This allows you to focus on the highest quality for both your internship and your studies. Jonsson Career Services (per the CPT Orientation PPT linked on the page) Students may have only one employer at a time. Students may not hold an on-campus job, be a grader, RA, or have a TA contract and work an internship at the same time. ** If you are a PhD student who has a TA position within your department, speak to an Internship Coordinator before you accept an internship offer.** Students may not hold an on-campus job, be a grader, RA, or have a TA contract and work an internship at the same time. ** If you are a PhD student who has a TA position within your department, speak to an Internship Coordinator before you accept an internship offer.** In general, work during F-1 employment authorization periods should not be conducted remotely while you are outside of the country.

https://isso.utdallas.edu/employment-and-internships/is-employment/opt-extension,STEM OPT Extension - International Students and Scholars Office | The University of Texas at Dallas,Frequently Asked Questions,"Yes. However, the new employer must be enrolled in E-Verify. Follow the reporting procedures in the ""Report STEM OPT Employment"" section. After an updated I-20 has been issued, we recommend sending an amendment to USCIS to let them know what has changed. This is an ISSO recommendation, not a USCIS requirement. If you applied online, you may upload your documents through the USCIS Portal. If you mailed your paper application, you may send the following documents to the address listed on your I-797C Receipt Notice. Copy of I-797C Receipt Notice Letter of explanation (written by you) briefly describing the change. Include the new employer's E-Verify number in your letter. Copy of updated I-20, pages 1 and 2 Proof of employment with new employer If USCIS received your STEM OPT application before your Post-Completion OPT EAD end date, then you are automatically eligible for a 180-day extension of your OPT. This means you can continue to work for an additional 180 days past your Post-Completion OPT end date, pending a decision from USCIS. During this time, your employment should meet all of the requirements for STEM OPT employment. You may submit your STEM Validation report up to 30 days before your due date and up to 10 days after your due date. If you miss your due date, submit your forms as soon as possible. Timely reporting is part of maintaining your F-1 status. ISSO advisors can only record your validation report during the validation reporting window. If you submit a validation report late, we may not be able to update your SEVIS record to reflect the validation. In this case, we will keep copies of your reporting documents with your student record. F-1 students may not volunteer for an employer during the STEM OPT extension. Employment must be for more than 20 hours a week. The employment must be compensated. The employer must be E-Verified. The employment must include a legitimate employer, employee relationship , including on-site supervision and training by experienced and knowledgeable staff. The employment must be directly related to the STEM degree that the work authorization was based upon. A student is allowed to work for multiple employers while on a period of STEM OPT. However, each employment must meet all of the student and employer requirements outlined above. No. Your I-983 Training Plan is considered both proof of employment and proof that your job relates to your program of study. No, volunteer or unpaid employment does not meet STEM OPT requirements. During the first year of Post-Completion OPT, you are allowed 90 days of unemployment. Once approved for the STEM OPT extension, you are given an additional 60 days of unemployment. During the entire three-year period (Post-Completion OPT and STEM OPT) you may accrue a total of 150 days of unemployment. It is crucial that you report all periods of employment to avoid unnecessary accrual of unemployment days. Exceeding your allowed unemployment days is a violation of your F-1 status. Approved time off from work, such as approved vacation leave or company holidays, is not considered unemployment. If you are on STEM OPT and exceed 150 cumulative days of unemployment , you have violated your F-1 status. DHS may terminate your SEVIS record and you may be subject to deportation. You should take action before accruing 150 days of unemployment to maintain valid F-1 status. If you are unable to find sufficient employment, you can: Begin a new program at UT Dallas Transfer your SEVIS record to another U.S. institution. Depart the U.S. In general, work during F-1 employment authorization periods should not be conducted remotely while you are outside of the country. Time abroad during OPT/STEM may also be counted as unemployed time by USCIS. Please see our Travel during CPT/OPT/STEM newsletter for more information. Your validation report due dates are based on the start date of your STEM OPT period, not the start date of employment. You should complete the OPT STEM Reporting Form and I-983 Evaluation on Student Progress on page 5 with your employer. Make sure to submit your validation report no later than 10 days past the due date. After the STEM OPT end date , there is a 60-day grace period in which you can: Start another academic program at UT Dallas Transfer to another school Change to another visa category Leave the U.S.* *Notify the ISSO of your departure by submitting an OPT STEM Reporting Form so that a note can be placed in your immigration record. No, reporting in the SEVP Portal is not required. You must report all changes directly to the ISSO. The Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) portal allows active F-1 alumni on Post Completion OPT and STEM OPT to view and change some of their immigration information. The SEVP Portal shares information with the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), but does not give you direct access to SEVIS. The SEVP Portal also does NOT remove the need for F-1 alumni to report changes to the ISSO. Please see the ISSO SEVP Portal for detailed information about the SEVP Portal."

Proposed Social Media Review for Immigration Processes USCIS has outlined a proposal to seek access and review social media accounts of individuals applying for citizenship, residency, or asylum in the U.S.  USCIS is arguing that collecting this data is necessary to comply with Trump's executive order: Protecting the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats . The proposal has been opened for public comments until May 5, 2025, at 11:59pm EDT . USCIS Ombudsman Offices Eliminated by Administration In the midst of the current administration's downsizing of various U.S. federal agencies, three immigration support offices have been eliminated: DHS Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman, and Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman. The USCIS Ombudsman office was previously a common resource for non-immigrant international students dealing with tricky application cases. The affected offices have sued to have their jobs reinstated by federal judges, and are awaiting a decision. Possible Rise in Visa Renewal Denials Resulting in Active Visa Revocation When applying to renew a U.S. visa, consular officers have the discretion to deny renewal applications based on current immigration policies. Additionally, if the applicant's current visa is still active and unexpired at the time, officers also have the discretion to revoke the current active visa upon denial of the renewal. It is unclear in what scenarios a visa renewal denial may also cause a revocation, but it is possible these instances may be increasing. If this occurs, an applicant would be unable to return to the U.S. until they are successfully granted a new visa. At this time, it may be safest to refrain from departing the U.S. to renew a visa unless absolutely necessary – especially in scenarios where the difficulty of renewal is already increased, such as during periods of F-1 OPT or J-1 AT."
https://isso.utdallas.edu/2025/04/16/immigration-news-april-2025,Immigration News April 2025 - International Students and Scholars Office | The University of Texas at Dallas,Seasonal Reminders,"Deadline: April 15, 2025 . All non-resident aliens who resided in the United States between January 1 and December 31 of 2024 must file a U.S. tax form. Refer to the ISSO webpage for resources to help you file your taxes: https://isso.utdallas.edu/employment-and-internships/taxes/ . If you have any additional questions about tax filing, contact the UT Dallas Tax Compliance Office at taxcompliance@utdallas.edu. Prepare for Summer Travel & Fall 2025 Physical Presence Visit the International Center webpages for Traveling Inside the U.S. and Traveling Outside the U.S for specific details on what immigration documents to carry when traveling. Remember that the law requires anyone who is not a U.S. citizen to carry evidence of status at all times. While summer enrollment is not required for most continuing students, we would like to remind all current students of your face-to-face enrollment and physical presence requirements for Fall 2025. To fulfill your F-1 status requirements, you must be physically present in the U.S. – on campus or at your designated educational site (such as a CPT internship) each fall and spring semester. ISSO requires all continuing F-1 students to complete ""Current Student Check In"" and submit proof of their current presence in the U.S. before each fall and spring semester by submitting a copy of your most recent I-94 in iComet . You should anticipate timely submitting your re-entry information to the ISSO and plan your summer travel accordingly to ensure that you return prior to the start of fall classes. The Current Student Check In form will be available in iComet 30 days before the start of classes, and must be completed no later than Census Day. Keep an eye on your UTD email for any updates or changes in U.S. immigration policy that may affect travel or re-entry to the U.S. Think carefully and prepare before you travel, especially if you are travelling internationally. If you applied for graduation this Spring, but find that you will not be eligible for graduation, notify the ISSO before May 24, 2025 and request an extension of your I-20 . Failure to notify the ISSO in time may result in being ineligible for an extension and loss of your F-1 status. Submit your complete program extension request to ISSODocuments@utdallas.edu as soon as you know you will not graduate. The ISSO strongly recommends that if you have any doubts that you may not complete your graduation requirements this term: do not request an OPT I-20 until you are certain that you will complete your program as planned. Applying for OPT and then failing to graduate can cause complications or endangerment of your F-1 status. Additionally, issuing your OPT I-20 shortens your I-20 program end date, which means there is much less time to make corrections to your immigration status if there is an issue with your graduation requirements later. If you have already applied for Optional Practical Training and you find that you will not graduate this semester, you must notify the ISSO as soon as possible. Failure to notify the ISSO before your program end date on your I-20 could negatively affect your F-1 status. Academic Probation As we reach the midpoint of the semester, it's important to remember the impact of your academic progress on both your academic goals and immigration status. If you anticipate challenges that may affect your ability to pass your classes and enroll in a future semester, it's important to act immediately. Your F-1 immigration status is contingent on maintaining satisfactory academic progress. If you foresee any difficulties in meeting the academic requirements, we strongly advise you to reach out to your academic department/advisors and the ISSO. Per Department of Homeland Security regulations, your F-1 status will be terminated upon notification from the registrar's office that a dismissal/academic suspension was granted. If you improve your GPA and no longer expect to be on academic probation for the upcoming semester, you can disregard this information.  The ISSO strongly advises you to speak with your academic department regarding your academic standing and GPA to confirm if this applies to your unique situation. Enrolling in summer classes is optional unless you meet any one of the criteria below: If summer is your first semester at UT Dallas, your first semester in F-1 status (Example: After being approved for a change of status to F-1), or summer is the first semester of your I-20 Program Dates for a new/continuing program (Example: After receiving a change of level I-20). If it is your final semester at UT Dallas in F-1 or J-1 status (Example: You have filed for graduation for the summer semester). File for graduation by the Graduation Application deadline. If you are a TA/RA student that may have additional enrollment requirements as a condition of their employment. If any of the scenarios above apply to you, you are required to enroll for the summer semester. For more information visit the International Student Enrollment webpage. If you are an international student enrolled in Summer 2025 classes, you are automatically assessed a student health insurance fee to cover the cost of the Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP).  If you choose to obtain alternative insurance you must request a waiver of the student health insurance fee if you want a waiver of the SHIP coverage. If you will be taken classes at UTD this summer while NOT residing in the United States, please email stuhealthinsurance@utdallas.edu for more information about health insurance requirements. The waiver requests must be submitted online each semester . If you are not enrolled in summer classes, then you are not automatically enrolled in the SHIP. However, the Student Health Center recommends that you maintain health insurance coverage continuously while in the U.S. If you have any questions about the waiver or purchasing summer insurance coverage, email stuhealthinsurance@utdallas.edu, or visit the Student Health Center website. The Estimated Expenses used to issue new I-20 documents and I-20 program extensions will be updated Spring 2025, final effective date TBA.

During this period, prospective petitioners and representatives must use a USCIS online account to register each beneficiary electronically for the selection process and pay the associated registration fee for each beneficiary. As a reminder, H-1B electronic registration DOES NOT grant Cap Gap Extension benefits to F-1 students and alumni . See below for more information about electronic registration. Employers must complete an electronic registration process as a part of the H-1B petition process. Registration opens in March. If you need copies of your UT Dallas I-20 forms, complete the Immigration Document Copy Request through the iComet Portal . Please keep in mind, the ISSO can only provide copies of documents that we have on file. It is the your responsibility to maintain your immigration records. H-1B registration DOES NOT provide Cap Gap Extension eligibility . Any Cap Gap Extension is based on the filing date (when the full application is sent to USCIS), not the registration date. You will receive both a registration notice after electronic registration and a receipt notice after filing the application. Only the receipt notice can be used for Cap Gap Extension benefits. DOS Announces Revised Visa Interview Waiver Policy In a February 18, 2025 Interview Waiver Update the Department of State announced changes to its policies on eligibility for waivers of the in-person visa interview requirement. The update rescinds prior expansions of interview waiver authority, for example, reinstating the statutory 12-month post-expiration period for applicants who previously held a visa in the same category . This marks a shift from the previous policy, which allowed interview waivers for applicants whose prior visa had expired within the past 48 months. Consular officers may still require in-person interviews on a case-by-case basis or because of local conditions.  We encourage applicants to check embassy and consulate websites for more detailed information about visa application requirements and procedures, and to learn more about the embassy or consulate's operating status and services."

https://icp.utdallas.edu/students/post-arrival-resources/institutional-requirements,Institutional Requirements  - Intercultural Programs | The University of Texas at Dallas,Mandatory Tuberculosis Screening,"By now, you must have made an appointment to take your Tuberculosis (TB) screening. This screening must be completed before you can attend your classes. Tuberculosis (TB) screening is required for all persons born outside the United States, regardless of the status of their application. Screening for TB must be administered, regardless of prior BCG vaccination, no more than six months prior to the first day of class. The only acceptable TB screening option for international students registering for classes is the Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) blood test (T-Spot). The T-Spot test must be administered and interpreted in the United States by a licensed medical provider. International students who do not complete a TB screening or who do not submit the appropriate documentation will not be allowed to register for classes. A physical picture ID (passport, driver's license or state ID) will be required for the TB screening. Being granted the resident tuition rate does not exempt an international student from this requirement. The T-Spot test is available on-campus through the Student Health Center for $150 (if not covered by the Student Health Insurance). This fee will be applied to your student account. You will pay the fee when you pay other charges you may owe the University after you register for classes. If you receive the T-Spot test prior to the semester for which you will be attending UT Dallas, you will be responsible for the charges the same day you receive your test. If you have questions, please call the Student Health Center at 972-883-2747 ."
https://icp.utdallas.edu/students/post-arrival-resources/institutional-requirements,Institutional Requirements  - Intercultural Programs | The University of Texas at Dallas,Meningitis Vaccination Requirement,"Per Texas Senate Bill no. 62 , beginning January 1, 2012, all entering Texas college students, under the age of 22, must receive a vaccination or booster (if the vaccination is five years old) against bacterial meningitis before enrollment. Acceptable forms of the vaccination include Meningococcal Conjugate Vaccine (MenACWY), Meningococcal Conjugate Vaccines (MCV) or Meningococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine (MPSV4). The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (THECB) notes the vaccination with the MenB vaccine should not replace the vaccination with MENACWY. Therefore, it does not constitute as a replacement for the meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) and does not fulfill the vaccination requirement. Before you will be allowed to register in classes you must submit: A completed Meningococcal Meningitis Vaccine Requirement Form (pdf) Proof of immunization or the Affidavit for Exemption from Immunizations for Reasons of Conscience. Initiate your request to TDSHS well before your intended orientation date. It may take several weeks to receive your form during peak times. Only original copies of Affidavits are accepted.

The Student Health Insurance Office issues waivers for international students who meet established eligibility criteria and prove they have comparable coverage that meets the UT System requirement . However, please note that it is not possible to waive health insurance altogether. Because eligibility for UT SHIP is contingent upon class enrollment at UT Dallas, insurance cards cannot be sent until a student is officially registered, which is Census Day. Please consult the resource webpage in case you need an interim coverage letter before you receive your insurance card, need to print or request an insurance card or accessing a digital insurance card."

The property owner may use a blank piece of paper, a computer storage file, or sheet that can be picked up at the Police Department to write down all valuable items. The information should include the item, the serial number, model number or name, value, color, and size. The property owner may also check out an engraver from the Police Department for free to place the owner's driver's license number or other personal number on the property. This number should also be included on the inventory sheet. The owner then places a copy of the paperwork in a safe location such as a fire safe or a safe deposit box at a bank. Photographs or videos of expensive items such as jewelry are also recommended for future use if needed for the police or insurance claims."
https://police.utdallas.edu/crime-prevention,Crime Prevention - Police Department | The University of Texas at Dallas,VIN Etching,"Every vehicle that is manufactured has a 17 digit serial number known as a VIN or a Vehicle Identification Number. The most common places to find a VIN number are the dashboard by the windshield in front of the driver seat or on the driver door panel on a sticker known at the Nader sticker. It is common for vehicle thieves to remove the VIN numbers or VIN tags from a vehicle to make tracking the vehicle more difficult for law enforcement. The professional car thief wants to avoid having any property or car parts in their shop that could link them to a reported stolen vehicle. The VIN etching program is a free service where law enforcement officers place your VIN number for your vehicle onto all of the glass windows of the vehicle. This process takes approximately 10 minutes to complete and makes your vehicle less desirable to a car thief. You are also eligible to save up to 10 percent on your comprehensive car insurance premium. Many car dealerships offer this same service at a fee to the car owner. The VIN Etching program is held once or twice a year on campus. Contact the Crime Prevention Unit for the next scheduled event. On another note: Please remove your keys from the ignition of your vehicle. In Texas, one in five cars is stolen because the owner left the keys inside the car. It is a violation of the law to leave your keys inside your ignition. Avoid having your car stolen and possibly receiving a citation by simply removing your keys when you park your car."

You must receive an I-20 and pay the I-901 prior to applying for the F-1 visa interview. Failure to pay the I-901 SEVIS fee 30 days before your program start date will result in the cancellation of your SEVIS record. Consular Officers may ask you questions based on topics including: academic, financial, immigration history and ties to your home country. To better prepare for your visa interview, review some common F-1 visa questions you may get asked. In addition, you may also review a NAFSA resource: 10 Point to Remember When Applying for an F-1 Student Visa F and J students are required to pay the SEVIS I-901 fee ($350 USD).

A receipt will also be mailed to the address listed on the I-901 form. If you decide to pay via Internet, we strongly suggest that you print a copy of the payment confirmation and keep it with your immigration documents. By mail : You can submit the I-901 form and a check or money order that has been drawn from a U.S. bank and is payable in U.S. dollars. Many foreign banks are able to issue checks drawn from a U.S. bank or foreign subsidiaries of a U.S. bank. A receipt will be mailed to the address listed on the I-901. In person through the Western Union Quick Pay service : It is imperative that you read the instructions for this payment option and bring a printed copy of the instructions and the sample of the completed Western Union form to the Western Union Agent in order to correctly process your payment.

Review the instructions at the U.S. embassy/consulate where they will apply. Dependents should bring the following additional documents: Their own documents and copies of the F-1 or J-1's documents if they apply for their visa separately. Proof of the relationship between themselves and the F-1 or J-1 such as a birth certificate or marriage certificate. Pay the visa application fee. Check the U.S. embassy/consulate website where you will apply for instructions and to see whether to pay this fee before the visa interview. Instructions will vary by embassy or consulate. Generally you will schedule the appointment at the U.S. embassy/consulate in your home country. You will attend an interview with a Department of State visa officer, who will determine whether you are eligible for the visa. Every embassy and consulate functions separately and may have slightly different procedures. For example, digital fingerprints may be taken depending on the U.S. embassy/consulate where you will apply. The visa officer can evaluate your application based on a variety of factors, including but not limited to the following: F-1 and J-1 visas are non-immigrant visas, meaning the visa holder intends to return to their home country at the end of their stay. Be able to provide evidence of non-immigrant intent by demonstrating you have ties to your home country and will return home after your program is complete. Some ways to show intent to return to your home country: Proof of residence in your home country Proof of ownership of property in your home country Proof of immediate relatives residing in your home country Proof of bank accounts in your home country Job offers or plans to pursue a career in your home country When applying for an F-1 or J-1 visa, you must show that you have sufficient funds to support yourself during your stay. You must show sufficient funds to cover living expenses, tuition and fees, books, etc. J-1s are required to maintain health insurance and must show proof of health insurance for themselves and any dependents throughout the length of their program. The visa officer may ask about your academic plans and why you want to attend UT Dallas. Be prepared to discuss your academic plans: Articulate why you want to attend UT Dallas specifically What you plan to study How you plan to use your education when you return to your home country Make sure you understand your academic program and how it fits your career plans Employment in the US is a potential immigration benefit, but not the primary purpose. F-1 and J-1 visas are student and exchange visitor visas, not work visas. As a participant of an Exchange Visitor Program, you may be subject to the Two-year Home-Country Physical Requirement or 212(e) requirement. Further administrative processing may be required. If that is the case, the visa officer will inform you. If your visa is approved, you will be told when your passport with the visa stamp will be returned to you. You may review the visa processing times website to learn about typical visa processing times."

https://isso.utdallas.edu/employment-and-internships/is-employment/post-completion-opt,Post-Completion OPT - International Students and Scholars Office | The University of Texas at Dallas,OPT Frequently Ask Questions,"You may not lawfully begin employment, or pre-employment training, until you receive your EAD and the start date has arrived. If you work during a gap between previous work authorization (such as CPT or on-campus work) and the start of your OPT authorization, you violate your F-1 status. DHS has ruled that acceptable employment during OPT can include standard employment, contract employment, self-employment and volunteer positions. All employment must be directly related to your degree and must be more than 20 hours per week. Please refer to the following chart for more details. Working in a paid position with an employer. A student may work for more than one employer, but all employment must meet the requirements for OPT (directly related to the degree program and more than 20 hours per week). To remain in the U.S., you must be actively looking for relevant employment. In order to maintain your visa status, you must limit unemployment while on OPT to a total of 90 days during your 12 months of Post-Completion OPT. Commonly referred to as 1099 employment, where an individual performs a service based on a contractual relationship rather than an employment relationship. If requested by DHS, you must be able to provide evidence that you worked an average of more than 20 hours per week, as well as evidence showing the duration of the contract and the name and address of the contracting company. If requested by DHS, you must be able to provide evidence showing that you worked an average of more than 20 hours per week. A student may work as a volunteer or unpaid intern, where this practice does not violate any labor laws. If requested by DHS, you must be able to provide evidence that you worked an average of more than 20 hours per week. This option is not available to students during the 24-month OPT extension period. On the OPT reporting form, list your company's name or print ""Self-Employed"" and the business address. This location may be the same as your personal address. If requested by DHS, you must be able to provide evidence that you have proper business licenses, the business is related to your degree, and that the business keeps you full-time employed. UT Dallas does not permit alumni to volunteer on campus. While the immigration regulations allow volunteer and unpaid work during OPT, university policy does not allow it on the UT Dallas campus. During your 12 months of Post-Completion OPT, you can be unemployed for a maximum of 90 days (including holidays and weekends). It is crucial that you report all periods of employment to avoid unnecessary accrual of unemployment days. Unemployment days begin accruing on your EAD start date. Unemployment days do not accrue during the time between your graduation and the start date listed on your EAD card. Approved time off from work, such as approved vacation leave or company holidays, is not considered unemployment. If you exceed 90 days of unemployment, you have violated your F-1 status. DHS may terminate your SEVIS record and you may be subject to deportation. You should take action before accruing 90 days of unemployment to maintain valid F-1 status. If you are unable to find sufficient employment, you can: Begin a new program at UT Dallas Transfer your SEVIS record to another U.S. institution. Depart the U.S. In general, work during F-1 employment authorization periods should not be conducted remotely while you are outside of the country. Time abroad during OPT/STEM may also be counted as unemployed time by USCIS. Please see our Travel during CPT/OPT/STEM newsletter for more information. Issuing an OPT I-20 when there is a possibility of dismissal significantly endangers your F-1 status. Depending on the circumstances, it can cause complications or even total loss of your legal status in the United States, and it also shortens the amount of time to salvage your status if you fail to graduate as planned. In addition, there is a general expectation in the spirit of the F-1 regulations that off-campus employment authorizations should be recommended while in good academic standing. You may apply for a Post-Completion OPT I-20 at the end of the term, after your final grades have been posted and you receive confirmation that you will graduate as expected. You still have a 60 day period after your program end date to apply for Post-Completion OPT."

To remedy this, USCIS may provide a temporary extension of F-1 status and/or work authorization while the H-1B petition is being processed. As of January 17, 2025 , a DHS Final Rule for H-1B has gone into effect per the published Federal Register . The primary effect this final ruling has for applicants applying for a Change of Status from F-1 to H-1B is the latest possible end date for a Cap Gap extension has been further extended from October 1 to April 1 of the H-1B fiscal year requested in your filed application. From the Federal Register: ""DHS is also providing flexibility to students seeking to change their status to H-1B by automatically extending the duration of their F-1 status, and any employment authorization granted under 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(3)(i)(B) or (C) , until April 1 of the relevant fiscal year to avoid disruptions in lawful status and employment authorization while a petition requesting a change of status to H-1B is pending. See new 8 CFR 214.2(f)(5)(vi)(A) ."""
https://isso.utdallas.edu/employment-and-internships/is-employment/h1b-visa,H-1B Cap Gap - International Students and Scholars Office | The University of Texas at Dallas,Related Pages,"Under the new rule, this benefit is offered from April 1 of the current H-1B filing period to April 1 of the following year, and only in conjunction with a corporate H-1B petition that is pending or approved with a start date any time within the fiscal year. An H-1B petition can not be filed more than 6 months before the requested start date of the H-1B status (8 CFR 214.2(h)(2)(i)(J)). If the time between the filing date and start date is more than 6 months, this would make an applicant ineligible for Cap Gap, and may cause a denial of the application. An H-1B fiscal year is from October 1 to September 30 of the following year. Under the previous rule, a cap-subject H-1B petition had to request an October 1 start date or it would not have qualified the petition for cap-gap benefits. The extension begins the day after the OPT EAD end date (or the day after the grace period end date, depending on when the application is filed) and ends on April 1 of the fiscal year for which such H-1B status is being requested or until the validity start date of the approved petition, whichever is earlier. The automatic extension terminates when USCIS rejects, denies, or revokes the H-1B petition. You can request an I-20 and a status verification letter that indicates this extension. You remain in F-1 status until the H-1B start date, or until the end of the Cap Gap extension. You should continue to maintain your F-1 status by submitting Post-Completion or STEM OPT Reporting as appropriate. An H-1B petition can not be filed more than 6 months before the requested start date of the H-1B status (8 CFR 214.2(h)(2)(i)(J)). If the time between the filing date and start date is more than 6 months, this would make an applicant ineligible for Cap Gap, and may cause a denial of the application. An H-1B fiscal year is from October 1 to September 30 of the following year. Under the previous rule, a cap-subject H-1B petition had to request an October 1 start date or it would not have qualified the petition for cap-gap benefits. The automatic extension terminates when USCIS rejects, denies, or revokes the H-1B petition. If your H-1B petition is denied or withdrawn and your OPT has ended, your status ends 60 days from the date posted on your denial/withdrawal. Please notify the ISSO if this occurs."

Registration opens in March. If your registration is selected for the lottery, USCIS will mail a registration notice to your employer with details about when to file the application. The registration notice by itself does not grant any cap gap benefits. After filing the petition with USCIS, your employer will receive an I-797C Receipt Notice. This notice confirms that the application has been received by USCIS. The filing date on the receipt notice is used to determine your H-1B Cap Gap benefits, not the date on your registration notice. The date that the complete H-1B Petition is filed with USCIS determines whether you will have an extension of your F-1 status and/or work authorization."

This term means that the H-1B petition meets all of the following criteria. Indicating change of status rather than consular processing. Was filed (not just registered) during the H-1B acceptance period. Applicant is in valid F-1 status either as a student, or on OPT, or on grace period. The Cap Gap extension may include work authorization, or it may be for your status only. The type of Cap Gap extension you are eligible for depends on your OPT end date and the date in which your H-1B petition was filed. Note, filing the H-1B petition is not the same as completing the online registration. Online registration by itself does not confer any Cap Gap benefits. If your H-1B petition is filed before your OPT end date (and if your OPT will end before April 1 of the upcoming fiscal year), you are eligible for an extension of status and work authorization. If your H-1B petition is filed during your 60-day grace period (and your grace period ends before April 1 of the upcoming fiscal year), you are eligible for an extension of your status only (no work authorization).

USCIS has stated that you should wait 10 days after receiving proof of the I-797 before applying for the renewal of the driver's license. If you have F-2 dependents, they will also need to take proof of the relationship, and proof of the primary F-1 immigration status. Please note that F-2 dependent driver's license requests often need to be referred to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) system to verify immigration status. This will result in a longer wait time for the renewal. For more information, please see the DMV factsheet. SEVP recommends that you do not travel outside the US during the cap gap extension, if possible, as USCIS will consider a change of status application abandoned if the applicant leaves the country while the application remains pending. If you must travel, you must have a valid EAD in order to return in F-1 status. Otherwise, please speak with an immigration attorney about re-entering in H-1B status. Yes. You are not granted additional unemployment time for the Cap Gap period. F-1 students in their initial 12 months of OPT may accrue up to 90 days of unemployment. F-1 students who are in their 24-Month STEM OPT period may accrue up to 150 days of unemployment. Accruing more than the allowed amount of unemployment time is a violation of your F-1 status. Yes. Your OPT reporting requirements remain the same until your new status begins. You should continue to maintain your F-1 status during the Cap Gap period by reporting any change of address, legal name change and changes in employment within 10 days. Students in a period of STEM OPT should continue to submit a validation report every sixth months. You must remain in contact with the employer that filed the I-129 Petition for a Nonimmigrant on your behalf. Until USCIS issues receipt notices, only the employer will know when the application is properly filed or waitlisted. You may obtain evidence from your employer for either of these two events and ask the ISSO to request an I-20 documenting your extension. In the event that the information is not reflected in SEVIS, ISSO may request a data fix of your SEVIS record. The data fix is completed by the SEVIS Help Desk and may take several weeks. Sometimes the SEVIS database does not update automatically after USCIS receives an application. If your H-1B application was receipted or approved, and your SEVIS record does not properly reflect this status, ISSO can request a data fix to correct your record. ISSO will need a copy of the receipt or approval notice (Form I-797) to request the data fix. The data fix is completed by the SEVIS Help Desk and may take several weeks."

https://isso.utdallas.edu/employment-and-internships/hiref1,Employer Resources - International Students and Scholars Office | The University of Texas at Dallas,Why Hire International Students?,"In an increasingly global workforce, international students bring valuable perspectives and insights to your company. International students are often highly skilled workers in their home country who have come to the U.S. to further their professional and personal goals. Concerned about navigating the immigration system? Hiring international students is not as complicated as you might think. Most UT Dallas international students are on F-1 or J-1 visas, meaning that the university sponsors their stay in the U.S. while they are receiving education and training. F-1 students are eligible to work off-campus under Curricular Practical Training (CPT) or Optional Practical Training (OPT) . J-1 exchange visitors can work off-campus with Academic Training . Employer sponsorship is not required to hire an international student on CPT, OPT, or Academic Training. The student's immigration record is maintained by the university, not the employer. The University Career Center has great resources for employers looking to connect with UT Dallas and our international students ."
https://isso.utdallas.edu/employment-and-internships/hiref1,Employer Resources - International Students and Scholars Office | The University of Texas at Dallas,CPT,"Curricular Practical Training allows F-1 students to participate in an internship or co-op experience while they pursue their degree. Work authorization is granted by the university, and it can take up to two weeks for CPT approval. UT Dallas is committed to ensuring all of our F-1 students have thorough documentation of the CPT employment, for future immigration applications, and all CPT requests go through a multi-stage approval process involving immigration advisors, academic advisors, and career advisors."
https://isso.utdallas.edu/employment-and-internships/hiref1,Employer Resources - International Students and Scholars Office | The University of Texas at Dallas,OPT,"F-1 students can participate in Optional Practical Training. Most commonly, students participate in a type of OPT called Post-Completion OPT, used for employment after graduating from a degree program. Post-Completion OPT can last up to 12 months. During Post-Completion OPT, the student's employment must be directly related to their most recent degree and must be full-time. For immigration purposes, ""full-time"" employment is considered ""more than 20 hours per week."" OPT work authorization is granted by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). While processing times can vary, it commonly takes three months or longer for an F-1 student to receive their Employment Authorization Document (EAD) card. The student must receive the EAD card, and the start date must arrive, before they can begin working."
https://isso.utdallas.edu/employment-and-internships/hiref1,Employer Resources - International Students and Scholars Office | The University of Texas at Dallas,STEM OPT,"F-1 students in certain STEM majors are eligible for a 24-month extension of Post-Completion OPT, allowing for a total of three years of employment. While STEM OPT does not require employer sponsorship, the employer does have some training obligations. There are more reporting requirements for F-1 students on STEM OPT, some of which require employer cooperation. We encourage employers to carefully review the information provided by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Employers may contact the ISSO at ISSOCurrent@utdallas.edu with any questions about STEM OPT requirements. The U.S. government has also provided helpful resources for employers on their STEM OPT Hub . We recommend that employers review these resources as they address many questions that employers may have about reporting requirements under the STEM OPT regulations."

The employment must include a legitimate employer-employee relationship. Staffing and temporary agencies may seek to employ students under the STEM OPT program, but only if they will be the entity that provides the practical training experience to the student at its own place of business and they have a bona fide employer-employee relationship with the student. For detailed information visit USCIS . The employment must be directly related to the STEM degree that the work authorization was based upon. A student is allowed to work for multiple employers while on a period of STEM OPT. However, each employment must meet all of the student and employer requirements outlined above."

Sections 1 – 6 of the form must be completed and signed by the student and employer before the student submits a request for a STEM OPT I-20. Homeland Security has provided specific instructions for employers on completing this form. If there are any changes to a student's employment, the student and employer must complete a Form I-983 and the student must submit it to the ISSO within 10 days of those changes. Changes in the plan can include (but are not limited to): Any change of Employer Identification Number resulting from a corporate restructuring. Any reduction in compensation from the amount previously submitted on the Form I‐983, ""Training Plan for STEM OPT Students,"" that is not tied to a reduction in hours worked. Any significant decrease in hours per week that a student engages in a STEM training opportunity. Please review the Form I-983 Instructional Video for additional assistance."

https://isso.utdallas.edu/employment-and-internships/hiref1,Employer Resources - International Students and Scholars Office | The University of Texas at Dallas,Special Employment Circumstances,The STEM OPT regulations limit the types of employment that students can participate in during the STEM OPT extension. Students who work for a start-up company may be eligible for the STEM OPT extension if there is another individual who can sign Form I-983 as the employer and establish a bona fide employer/employee relationship. Students who work for a consulting firm or staffing agency should discuss their situation and eligibility with their employer to determine if a true employer/employee relationship exists in which the employer signing the training plan is also the employer that provides the practical training experience.

U.S. Department of Homeland Security regulations require all F-1 students to be enrolled in classes within 30 days of their arrival in the U.S. If yes, you may proceed with the transfer If no, choose from the following: Option A: Enroll at UT Dallas for one semester and then transfer out Option B: Leave the U.S. and return later to attend the desired school. This option would require you to apply for authorized early withdrawal, obtain a new I-20 from the desired school, and pay the SEVIS I-901 fee again. Option C: Proceed to transfer to the desired school. This involves the termination of your SEVIS record and going through a reinstatement process to remain in the U.S. legally. Not all universities will accept a terminated SEVIS record.

Not all universities will accept a terminated SEVIS record. You will need to confirm with your desired school if they will accept your SEVIS record in terminated status Note: If you are considering options #2b or #2c mentioned above, contact a UT Dallas international student advisor for further details. If you have never attended classes at UT Dallas, refer to the Transfer Out Before Attending section. The transfer out fee WILL NOT apply to current and alumni students. To transfer to another institution when you are a current UT Dallas student or after Optional Practical Training (OPT), you need to: Gain admission to the new institution. Check what is needed by the new school to obtain a new I-20. Many schools require a form signed by an international student advisor to verify F-1 status. If so, submit the form to the UT Dallas ISSO. Note: This is an informational form, not a commitment to transfer. To request the transfer, you must submit: Admission letter from the new school on school letterhead Complete the Transfer Out Request eForm in iComet . This authorizes the ISSO to release your F-1 SEVIS immigration record to the new school. On the transfer release date, the UT Dallas record deactivates and all UT Dallas work authorizations end. The new school now has access to your immigration information. Complete the new institution's requirements to obtain a new I-20. Admission letter from the new school on school letterhead Complete the Transfer Out Request eForm in iComet . This authorizes the ISSO to release your F-1 SEVIS immigration record to the new school. The Transfer Out Request eForm in iComet will ask you for a ""transfer out release date"". There are several things to consider when choosing this date: You cannot continue to work on the UT Dallas campus beyond the release date. If you are a current UT Dallas student the date should be after the last semester of enrollment at UT Dallas. For example, if your last semester of enrollment at UT Dallas is the spring semester, the ""transfer out release date"" listed should be after the last day of the spring semester. If you are currently authorized for Optional Practical Training (OPT), the OPT automatically terminates when the ""transfer-out release date"" passes. Choose a release date that is after the last day you intend to work on OPT and no later than 60 days after the end of your OPT end date. If you are traveling internationally between the end of your last semester at UT Dallas and the first semester at the new institution, you cannot re-enter the U.S. after your transfer release date on your current UT Dallas I-20. You must obtain a Transfer Pending I-20 from the new school and re-enter using that document if you are re-entering after the release date. The transfer-in school may have deadlines to meet regarding transfer procedures and issuance of your new I-20. Check with the appropriate office at the new school.

Check out their detailed resources if you want to know more about how to use the SEVP Portal. Using the SEVP Portal is optional. Reporting to the ISSO during OPT is mandatory."
https://isso.utdallas.edu/employment-and-internships/is-employment/sevp-portal,SEVP Portal - International Students and Scholars Office | The University of Texas at Dallas,SEVP Portal FAQs,"If your OPT or STEM OPT is approved and your start date has arrived, check your UT Dallas email for an email with the link to set up your SEVP Portal account. You can recognize the email by the sender and subject lines: Subject Line: Optional Practical Training Approval – the next step. Create an SEVP Portal account The email contains a link you must use to create the account. The link is unique to you. You can only use the link once. If you are unable to start the registration process, ask the ISSO to have SEVP send you the email notice again by submitting an Ask an Advisor eForm in iComet . The SEVP Portal will lock your account if you do not log in to the portal for 90 days or after three failed attempts to log in to the system. You can reset your SEVP Portal password online by going to the SEVP Portal log in page . If you are an F-1 alumni, you will only obtain an invitation for the SEVP Portal if all of the following conditions have been met: Your SEVIS record reflects that you have been approved for Post Completion OPT and/or STEM OPT and The start date for your period of Post Completion OPT is either today, or is in the past, and Your SEVIS F-1 immigration record is 'Active' If you believe that you meet all of these conditions and you have not received an invitation for the portal to your UT Dallas email account, check your spam or junk mail folder. If you still cannot find the email, you may submit an Ask an Advisor eForm in iComet requesting the ISSO to have SEVP resend the email. No. The SEVP requires the ISSO to report a valid email address for each active F-1 student or alumni. Your @utdallas.edu email account will remain active during OPT to ensure the security and privacy of the communications. If you need assistance in accessing your UTD email account contact the UT Dallas Help Desk at assist@utdallas.edu or (972) 883-2911 . No, not unless you also report to the ISSO. Updating information in the SEVP Portal is optional. Reporting to the ISSO is mandatory. This ISSO is not notified directly when you make an update through the SEVP Portal. It is your responsibility to submit the correct reporting documents, depending on if you are on Post-Completion OPT or STEM OPT . Not all updates will generate a new I-20. After reporting to the ISSO, watch your UT Dallas email address for updates. We will send you a confirmation email as soon as your request is processed, and we will tell you whether the request generated a new I-20. No. The SEVP Portal does not allow you to print an I-20. Only the ISSO can issue your Form I-20. Yes. Updating the SEVIS Portal does not eliminate the need for you to report to ISSO. There are limits to what OPT information you can update in the SEVP Portal. The two most common reasons that the portal will not let you input employer information are: You are trying to add a new employer more than 10 days after the start date of the employment. SEVP will not accept new employer input in the student portal if you are outside of the 10 day reporting window. However, remember that reporting in the SEVP Portal is optional. As long as you submit your report directly to the ISSO (in iComet) within 10 days of employment or address changes, then you have timely reported and fulfilled your OPT requirements. DSOs in the ISSO can still report a past start date into SEVIS once your report is processed. You are on the STEM Extension. STEM OPT has much stricter reporting requirements, and most STEM employer information updates must be directly approved by a DSO with verification of your I-983 document. This means that for most STEM OPT reports (with the exception of small changes like a home address update), it may not be possible to report your updates directly in the SEVP Portal. It is also not possible to submit STEM validations in the SEVP Portal. See question below for more information. If you find that you are unable to report a certain update in the SEVP Portal, you only need to submit the reported changes in iComet to fulfill your reporting requirements. You must always report changes during OPT in iComet, whether or not you successfully report the update the SEVP Portal. No. You cannot submit STEM Validations through the SEVP Portal. All validations must be submitted directly into your SEVIS record by an ISSO DSO, after you have submitted the necessary information and documentation in iComet to begin the validation process. SEVP may send emails to remind you of your validation due dates, and will ask that you check that the information in your Portal appears up-to-date before you begin the validation process with your DSOs. However, checking your information alone does not validate your employment. Your next steps will be to follow the instructions on the STEM OPT Reporting web page, and timely report your validation to the ISSO in iComet within 10 days of each due date. The information you enter in the portal should be sent immediately to SEVIS to update your record. No. It can take a significant amount of time for the SEVIS database to transfer information to the SEVP Portal. No. At this point, you are not required to use the SEVP Portal. If you report via the SEVP Portal, you must also submit an OPT Reporting Form to meet your reporting obligations. No. There is no additional cost associated with creating an account or accessing the SEVP Portal. Do not pay any money to use the SEVP Portal."

https://isso.utdallas.edu/opt-extension,STEM OPT Extension - International Students and Scholars Office | The University of Texas at Dallas,Frequently Asked Questions,"Yes. However, the new employer must be enrolled in E-Verify. Follow the reporting procedures in the ""Report STEM OPT Employment"" section. After an updated I-20 has been issued, we recommend sending an amendment to USCIS to let them know what has changed. This is an ISSO recommendation, not a USCIS requirement. If you applied online, you may upload your documents through the USCIS Portal. If you mailed your paper application, you may send the following documents to the address listed on your I-797C Receipt Notice. Copy of I-797C Receipt Notice Letter of explanation (written by you) briefly describing the change. Include the new employer's E-Verify number in your letter. Copy of updated I-20, pages 1 and 2 Proof of employment with new employer If USCIS received your STEM OPT application before your Post-Completion OPT EAD end date, then you are automatically eligible for a 180-day extension of your OPT. This means you can continue to work for an additional 180 days past your Post-Completion OPT end date, pending a decision from USCIS. During this time, your employment should meet all of the requirements for STEM OPT employment. You may submit your STEM Validation report up to 30 days before your due date and up to 10 days after your due date. If you miss your due date, submit your forms as soon as possible. Timely reporting is part of maintaining your F-1 status. ISSO advisors can only record your validation report during the validation reporting window. If you submit a validation report late, we may not be able to update your SEVIS record to reflect the validation. In this case, we will keep copies of your reporting documents with your student record. F-1 students may not volunteer for an employer during the STEM OPT extension. Employment must be for more than 20 hours a week. The employment must be compensated. The employer must be E-Verified. The employment must include a legitimate employer, employee relationship , including on-site supervision and training by experienced and knowledgeable staff. The employment must be directly related to the STEM degree that the work authorization was based upon. A student is allowed to work for multiple employers while on a period of STEM OPT. However, each employment must meet all of the student and employer requirements outlined above. No. Your I-983 Training Plan is considered both proof of employment and proof that your job relates to your program of study. No, volunteer or unpaid employment does not meet STEM OPT requirements. During the first year of Post-Completion OPT, you are allowed 90 days of unemployment. Once approved for the STEM OPT extension, you are given an additional 60 days of unemployment. During the entire three-year period (Post-Completion OPT and STEM OPT) you may accrue a total of 150 days of unemployment. It is crucial that you report all periods of employment to avoid unnecessary accrual of unemployment days. Exceeding your allowed unemployment days is a violation of your F-1 status. Approved time off from work, such as approved vacation leave or company holidays, is not considered unemployment. If you are on STEM OPT and exceed 150 cumulative days of unemployment , you have violated your F-1 status. DHS may terminate your SEVIS record and you may be subject to deportation. You should take action before accruing 150 days of unemployment to maintain valid F-1 status. If you are unable to find sufficient employment, you can: Begin a new program at UT Dallas Transfer your SEVIS record to another U.S. institution. Depart the U.S. In general, work during F-1 employment authorization periods should not be conducted remotely while you are outside of the country. Time abroad during OPT/STEM may also be counted as unemployed time by USCIS. Please see our Travel during CPT/OPT/STEM newsletter for more information. Your validation report due dates are based on the start date of your STEM OPT period, not the start date of employment. You should complete the OPT STEM Reporting Form and I-983 Evaluation on Student Progress on page 5 with your employer. Make sure to submit your validation report no later than 10 days past the due date. After the STEM OPT end date , there is a 60-day grace period in which you can: Start another academic program at UT Dallas Transfer to another school Change to another visa category Leave the U.S.* *Notify the ISSO of your departure by submitting an OPT STEM Reporting Form so that a note can be placed in your immigration record. No, reporting in the SEVP Portal is not required. You must report all changes directly to the ISSO. The Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) portal allows active F-1 alumni on Post Completion OPT and STEM OPT to view and change some of their immigration information. The SEVP Portal shares information with the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), but does not give you direct access to SEVIS. The SEVP Portal also does NOT remove the need for F-1 alumni to report changes to the ISSO. Please see the ISSO SEVP Portal for detailed information about the SEVP Portal."

https://ic.utdallas.edu/isso/opt-extension,STEM OPT Extension - International Students and Scholars Office | The University of Texas at Dallas,Frequently Asked Questions,"Yes. However, the new employer must be enrolled in E-Verify. Follow the reporting procedures in the ""Report STEM OPT Employment"" section. After an updated I-20 has been issued, we recommend sending an amendment to USCIS to let them know what has changed. This is an ISSO recommendation, not a USCIS requirement. If you applied online, you may upload your documents through the USCIS Portal. If you mailed your paper application, you may send the following documents to the address listed on your I-797C Receipt Notice. Copy of I-797C Receipt Notice Letter of explanation (written by you) briefly describing the change. Include the new employer's E-Verify number in your letter. Copy of updated I-20, pages 1 and 2 Proof of employment with new employer If USCIS received your STEM OPT application before your Post-Completion OPT EAD end date, then you are automatically eligible for a 180-day extension of your OPT. This means you can continue to work for an additional 180 days past your Post-Completion OPT end date, pending a decision from USCIS. During this time, your employment should meet all of the requirements for STEM OPT employment. You may submit your STEM Validation report up to 30 days before your due date and up to 10 days after your due date. If you miss your due date, submit your forms as soon as possible. Timely reporting is part of maintaining your F-1 status. ISSO advisors can only record your validation report during the validation reporting window. If you submit a validation report late, we may not be able to update your SEVIS record to reflect the validation. In this case, we will keep copies of your reporting documents with your student record. F-1 students may not volunteer for an employer during the STEM OPT extension. Employment must be for more than 20 hours a week. The employment must be compensated. The employer must be E-Verified. The employment must include a legitimate employer, employee relationship , including on-site supervision and training by experienced and knowledgeable staff. The employment must be directly related to the STEM degree that the work authorization was based upon. A student is allowed to work for multiple employers while on a period of STEM OPT. However, each employment must meet all of the student and employer requirements outlined above. No. Your I-983 Training Plan is considered both proof of employment and proof that your job relates to your program of study. No, volunteer or unpaid employment does not meet STEM OPT requirements. During the first year of Post-Completion OPT, you are allowed 90 days of unemployment. Once approved for the STEM OPT extension, you are given an additional 60 days of unemployment. During the entire three-year period (Post-Completion OPT and STEM OPT) you may accrue a total of 150 days of unemployment. It is crucial that you report all periods of employment to avoid unnecessary accrual of unemployment days. Exceeding your allowed unemployment days is a violation of your F-1 status. Approved time off from work, such as approved vacation leave or company holidays, is not considered unemployment. If you are on STEM OPT and exceed 150 cumulative days of unemployment , you have violated your F-1 status. DHS may terminate your SEVIS record and you may be subject to deportation. You should take action before accruing 150 days of unemployment to maintain valid F-1 status. If you are unable to find sufficient employment, you can: Begin a new program at UT Dallas Transfer your SEVIS record to another U.S. institution. Depart the U.S. In general, work during F-1 employment authorization periods should not be conducted remotely while you are outside of the country. Time abroad during OPT/STEM may also be counted as unemployed time by USCIS. Please see our Travel during CPT/OPT/STEM newsletter for more information. Your validation report due dates are based on the start date of your STEM OPT period, not the start date of employment. You should complete the OPT STEM Reporting Form and I-983 Evaluation on Student Progress on page 5 with your employer. Make sure to submit your validation report no later than 10 days past the due date. After the STEM OPT end date , there is a 60-day grace period in which you can: Start another academic program at UT Dallas Transfer to another school Change to another visa category Leave the U.S.* *Notify the ISSO of your departure by submitting an OPT STEM Reporting Form so that a note can be placed in your immigration record. No, reporting in the SEVP Portal is not required. You must report all changes directly to the ISSO. The Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) portal allows active F-1 alumni on Post Completion OPT and STEM OPT to view and change some of their immigration information. The SEVP Portal shares information with the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), but does not give you direct access to SEVIS. The SEVP Portal also does NOT remove the need for F-1 alumni to report changes to the ISSO. Please see the ISSO SEVP Portal for detailed information about the SEVP Portal."
https://ic.utdallas.edu/isso/h1b-visa,H-1B Cap Gap - International Students and Scholars Office | The University of Texas at Dallas,H-1B Cap Gap,"Because corporate H-1B visas begin on October 1 at the earliest and most students graduate in May or December, there is often a gap of time between the OPT end date and the H-1B start date. To remedy this, USCIS may provide a temporary extension of F-1 status and/or work authorization while the H-1B petition is being processed. As of January 17, 2025 , a DHS Final Rule for H-1B has gone into effect per the published Federal Register . The primary effect this final ruling has for applicants applying for a Change of Status from F-1 to H-1B is the latest possible end date for a Cap Gap extension has been further extended from October 1 to April 1 of the H-1B fiscal year requested in your filed application. From the Federal Register: ""DHS is also providing flexibility to students seeking to change their status to H-1B by automatically extending the duration of their F-1 status, and any employment authorization granted under 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(3)(i)(B) or (C) , until April 1 of the relevant fiscal year to avoid disruptions in lawful status and employment authorization while a petition requesting a change of status to H-1B is pending. See new 8 CFR 214.2(f)(5)(vi)(A) ."""
https://ic.utdallas.edu/isso/h1b-visa,H-1B Cap Gap - International Students and Scholars Office | The University of Texas at Dallas,Related Pages,"Under the new rule, this benefit is offered from April 1 of the current H-1B filing period to April 1 of the following year, and only in conjunction with a corporate H-1B petition that is pending or approved with a start date any time within the fiscal year. An H-1B petition can not be filed more than 6 months before the requested start date of the H-1B status (8 CFR 214.2(h)(2)(i)(J)). If the time between the filing date and start date is more than 6 months, this would make an applicant ineligible for Cap Gap, and may cause a denial of the application. An H-1B fiscal year is from October 1 to September 30 of the following year. Under the previous rule, a cap-subject H-1B petition had to request an October 1 start date or it would not have qualified the petition for cap-gap benefits. The extension begins the day after the OPT EAD end date (or the day after the grace period end date, depending on when the application is filed) and ends on April 1 of the fiscal year for which such H-1B status is being requested or until the validity start date of the approved petition, whichever is earlier. The automatic extension terminates when USCIS rejects, denies, or revokes the H-1B petition. You can request an I-20 and a status verification letter that indicates this extension. You remain in F-1 status until the H-1B start date, or until the end of the Cap Gap extension. You should continue to maintain your F-1 status by submitting Post-Completion or STEM OPT Reporting as appropriate. An H-1B petition can not be filed more than 6 months before the requested start date of the H-1B status (8 CFR 214.2(h)(2)(i)(J)). If the time between the filing date and start date is more than 6 months, this would make an applicant ineligible for Cap Gap, and may cause a denial of the application. An H-1B fiscal year is from October 1 to September 30 of the following year. Under the previous rule, a cap-subject H-1B petition had to request an October 1 start date or it would not have qualified the petition for cap-gap benefits. The automatic extension terminates when USCIS rejects, denies, or revokes the H-1B petition. If your H-1B petition is denied or withdrawn and your OPT has ended, your status ends 60 days from the date posted on your denial/withdrawal. Please notify the ISSO if this occurs."

https://ic.utdallas.edu/isso/h1b-visa,H-1B Cap Gap - International Students and Scholars Office | The University of Texas at Dallas,Registration Notice VS Receipt Notice,"Employers must complete an electronic registration as a part of the H-1B petition process. Registration opens in March. If your registration is selected for the lottery, USCIS will mail a registration notice to your employer with details about when to file the application. The registration notice by itself does not grant any cap gap benefits. After filing the petition with USCIS, your employer will receive an I-797C Receipt Notice. This notice confirms that the application has been received by USCIS. The filing date on the receipt notice is used to determine your H-1B Cap Gap benefits, not the date on your registration notice. The date that the complete H-1B Petition is filed with USCIS determines whether you will have an extension of your F-1 status and/or work authorization."
https://ic.utdallas.edu/isso/h1b-visa,H-1B Cap Gap - International Students and Scholars Office | The University of Texas at Dallas,H-1B Cap Gap,"If you have timely filed and properly filed for H-1B, you may be eligible for a Cap Gap extension.

Was filed (not just registered) during the H-1B acceptance period. Applicant is in valid F-1 status either as a student, or on OPT, or on grace period. The Cap Gap extension may include work authorization, or it may be for your status only. The type of Cap Gap extension you are eligible for depends on your OPT end date and the date in which your H-1B petition was filed. Note, filing the H-1B petition is not the same as completing the online registration. Online registration by itself does not confer any Cap Gap benefits. If your H-1B petition is filed before your OPT end date (and if your OPT will end before April 1 of the upcoming fiscal year), you are eligible for an extension of status and work authorization. If your H-1B petition is filed during your 60-day grace period (and your grace period ends before April 1 of the upcoming fiscal year), you are eligible for an extension of your status only (no work authorization).

USCIS has stated that you should wait 10 days after receiving proof of the I-797 before applying for the renewal of the driver's license. If you have F-2 dependents, they will also need to take proof of the relationship, and proof of the primary F-1 immigration status. Please note that F-2 dependent driver's license requests often need to be referred to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) system to verify immigration status. This will result in a longer wait time for the renewal. For more information, please see the DMV factsheet. SEVP recommends that you do not travel outside the US during the cap gap extension, if possible, as USCIS will consider a change of status application abandoned if the applicant leaves the country while the application remains pending. If you must travel, you must have a valid EAD in order to return in F-1 status. Otherwise, please speak with an immigration attorney about re-entering in H-1B status. Yes. You are not granted additional unemployment time for the Cap Gap period. F-1 students in their initial 12 months of OPT may accrue up to 90 days of unemployment. F-1 students who are in their 24-Month STEM OPT period may accrue up to 150 days of unemployment. Accruing more than the allowed amount of unemployment time is a violation of your F-1 status. Yes. Your OPT reporting requirements remain the same until your new status begins. You should continue to maintain your F-1 status during the Cap Gap period by reporting any change of address, legal name change and changes in employment within 10 days. Students in a period of STEM OPT should continue to submit a validation report every sixth months. You must remain in contact with the employer that filed the I-129 Petition for a Nonimmigrant on your behalf. Until USCIS issues receipt notices, only the employer will know when the application is properly filed or waitlisted. You may obtain evidence from your employer for either of these two events and ask the ISSO to request an I-20 documenting your extension. In the event that the information is not reflected in SEVIS, ISSO may request a data fix of your SEVIS record. The data fix is completed by the SEVIS Help Desk and may take several weeks. Sometimes the SEVIS database does not update automatically after USCIS receives an application. If your H-1B application was receipted or approved, and your SEVIS record does not properly reflect this status, ISSO can request a data fix to correct your record. ISSO will need a copy of the receipt or approval notice (Form I-797) to request the data fix. The data fix is completed by the SEVIS Help Desk and may take several weeks."

Concurrent enrollment – Enroll at UT Dallas and another institution concurrently. Submit a Concurrent Enrollment Form to the UT Dallas ISSO by Census Day of each semester. Graduating semester – ""Graduating semester"" refers to the last semester of degree requirements, whether you are attending a graduation ceremony that semester or not. In your final semester, you meet full-time enrollment requirements by enrolling in all remaining courses, even if the total number of hours is less than the standard 9 or 12 credit hour requirement. To use this option you must: Be graduating from the major and degree listed on your I-20 Apply for graduation by Census Day . Enroll in at least one face-to-face course for the duration of the graduating semester. Additional courses needed to complete the degree in the graduating semester may be online, hybrid or face-to-face. Students with thesis/dissertation requirements who chose to apply for graduation by Priority Deadlines may have different enrollment requirements in their final semester. See the Graduation and Beyond page for more information about the impact of Priority Deadlines on F-1 Status. Reduced Course Load due to CPT – Graduate level students may be eligible for a Reduced Course Load authorization if they are participating in a full-time CPT that lasts at least 11 weeks. This option cannot be used in two consecutive long semesters (spring and fall), and a number of restrictions apply. See the CPT page for more details. This option is not available for undergraduate students. Reduced Course Load due to Academic or Medical Reasons – The Department of Homeland Security allows F-1 students to request a reduced course load in certain academic situations or due to medical reasons. You must submit the appropriate, signed request form and receive authorization prior to dropping below full-time enrollment. Reduced Course Load due to Thesis/Dissertation – Students who have completed all of their coursework and who are only required to enroll in a thesis/dissertation course may request a reduced course load. With this authorization, the student can enroll in fewer credit hours of the thesis/dissertation course. Students must take a minimum of 1 credit hour to maintain F-1 status. The academic department may require the student to take more than 1 credit hour to meet academic requirements. Study Abroad – Students who participate in UT Dallas-approved study abroad programs are enrolled full-time in a special UT Dallas course. Check the Education Abroad for International Students webpage for requirements and restrictions. For information about study abroad opportunities and requirements, contact Education Abroad .

https://isso.utdallas.edu/immigration-status/enroll-req,Enrollment Requirements - International Students and Scholars Office | The University of Texas at Dallas,F-1 Enrollment Charts,"The enrollment charts reflect the F-1 regulations and standard enrollment requirements. The temporary exception for fall 2022 changes what instruction type is acceptable, but does not change the required credit hours. SEVP defines two groups of F-1 students, with two separate enrollment requirements. F-1 students who were in Active F-1 status on March 9, 2020 can meet their full-time enrollment requirements with an entirely online course load. F-1 students who began their F-1 status after March 9, 2020 must take at least one course with in-person components each semester and should be prepared to participate in the in-person components. Students in this group must continue to enroll in at least one course with in-person components every semester. F-1 students must enroll full-time each fall and spring semester unless approved for a reduced course load. An undergraduate student enrolls in 15 credit hours, with 9 credit hours face-to-face and 6 credit hours online. This meets the enrollment requirements because the student is taking more than the minimum 12 credit hours, and at least 9 credit hours are face-to-face. A graduate student enrolls in 9 credit hours, with 3 credit hours online. This meets enrollment requirements because the student is taking the minimum required credit hours and is only counting one online course towards the required hours. Summer enrollment is optional unless it is your first semester at UT Dallas, in F-1 status, in a new program of study, or it is your graduating semester Summer enrollment is required if you are a transfer student whose first semester in the U.S. was spring, at another school, you have not completed an academic year in the U.S. and you transfer to UT Dallas for summer Summer enrollment is required if you are a transfer student whose SEVIS release date is before summer classes begin If you do not meet one of these criteria, enrollment is optional. You may take any number of classes of any instruction type, or you can take zero classes. A student who began their program of study at UT Dallas in the spring semester is considering whether to take summer classes. Summer enrollment is optional, since it is not the student's first semester in the U.S., in the program, in F-1 status, or their graduating semester. The student decides to enroll in one online course. If the student needs to drop the class later, that is okay because summer enrollment is optional. The graduating semester enrollment requirements are the same, whether you are an undergraduate student or a graduate student. ""Graduating semester"" refers to the last semester of degree requirements, whether you are attending a graduation ceremony that semester or not. You must be completing the degree and major listed on your I-20 to be eligible to enroll less than full time. Students with thesis/dissertation requirements who apply for graduation by Priority Deadlines may have different enrollment requirements in their final semester. See the Graduation and Beyond page for more information about the impact of Priority Deadlines on F-1 Status. A student is graduating in spring and has three courses remaining to finish their degree. The student can enroll in one face-to-face course and two online courses to meet their enrollment requirements. A student is graduating in fall and only has one course remaining. In order to meet the physical presence requirement for enrollment, the student enrolls in a face-to-face section of the course that lasts for the entire semester."
https://isso.utdallas.edu/immigration-status/enroll-req,Enrollment Requirements - International Students and Scholars Office | The University of Texas at Dallas,Online and Hybrid Courses,"The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) requires F-1 students to enroll in a minimum number of ""physical presence"" courses each semester in order to meet the full-time enrollment requirement. Students who enroll in too many distance education (online or hybrid) courses and who do not take the minimum number of ""physical presence"" hours/courses violate their F-1 status. Distance Education is defined as a course where the student receives the majority of instruction in a way other than being present in a classroom on campus. CPT and independent research courses are not considered distance education courses. If you have questions regarding what is defined as a ""physical presence"" course or other elements of the full-time enrollment requirement, contact an international student advisor . Only one distance education course can count towards the total number of required credit hours for F-1 students. If a student has only one course remaining in the last semester before graduation, that course cannot be an online course."

This applies to both academic and non-academic withdrawals, as well as retroactive withdrawals completed after the semester end date. Students must take care to maintain their full-time enrollment and to obtain a reduced course load authorization prior to dropping below full-time enrollment, to avoid termination of their immigration status. For retroactive withdrawals, keep in mind that reduced course load authorizations cannot be backdated or retroactively approved. If a student retroactively withdraws and falls below full-time enrollment, their immigration record will be terminated."
https://isso.utdallas.edu/immigration-status/enroll-req,Enrollment Requirements - International Students and Scholars Office | The University of Texas at Dallas,F-1 / J-1 Status and Physical Presence,"F-1 and J-1 students have two different but overlapping requirements to fulfill the regulations for maintaining status: Enrollment requirements (how many and what modality of credits to enroll in) Physical presence requirements (being physically present in the U.S., either on campus or at designated educational site) Per the standard enrollment requirements, a specific proportion of your classes must be face-to-face. This means that there is a regulatory expectation for you to be physically attending the face-to-face courses that you are enrolled in . You should be physically present on campus and receiving face-to-face instruction for the majority of the semester, unless you have an ISSO authorized exception (CPT, AT, RCL, etc). Note that all CPT work should also take place within the U.S. , even if the position is remote. (Please see our Travel during CPT/OPT/STEM newsletter for more information.) If you are not meeting the presence requirement at the start of the term or for a significant amount of time during the semester, you risk violating your F-1 status and losing future immigration benefits. In order to verify the physical presence of current F-1 students, the ISSO requires all continuing students to submit proof of their current presence in the U.S. before each fall and spring semester by submitting a copy of your most recent I-94 in iComet. A 'Current Student Check-in' form is launched in the iComet portal for this purpose prior to each fall and spring term. You should anticipate timely submitting your re-entry information to the ISSO and plan any travel abroad accordingly to ensure that you return prior to the start of classes . The Check In must be completed no later than Census Day to ensure your status is not endangered. ISSO manually verifies J-1 student and scholar enrollment and physical presence each semester. For F-1 students, you are unable to arrive in time to complete Current Student Check-in, or you need to depart the U.S. for the majority of the term, then you will not be able to maintain your F-1 status. In order to receive a non-negative termination of your F-1 SEVIS record, you should complete the process of Authorized Early Withdrawal , ideally before Census Day. If you are able to return to the U.S. to continue your in-person studies within 5 months of your AEW, you have a chance to re-activate your existing SEVIS record and continue your F-1 status uninterrupted. Refer to the link for more information about AEW. Not meeting all enrollment or presence requirements can result in termination. All current/ continuing F-1 students will be responsible for verifying their physical presence in the U.S. at their designated educational site each fall and spring term by completing Current Student Check-in through iComet. Your enrollment each semester must meet also all of the above criteria, including the face-to-face requirements. If the physical presence or enrollment requirements are not met by Census Day, including if you have too many online or hybrid classes in your course load, your SEVIS record could be terminated if the issue is not corrected. For J-1 students and scholars, you should refer to J-1 advising if you believe you may not be able to meet the physical presence requirements for your status: ISSOJ1@utdallas.edu"

Failure to maintain lawful J-1 status can have serious long-term consequences. To ensure that a stay in the US remains valid: Be aware of the status expiration date. This is not the visa expiration date; but the ending date in section 3 of the DS-2019 form. If an appointment at the University is extended, the hiring department must contact HR before the current expiration date of the current form to have the DS-2019 form extended. (Note: Short-term scholars are only allowed to remain in the US for up to six months). Do not accept unauthorized employment. The only activity permitted is the one described in section 4 of the DS-2019 form. If offered a comparable position at another college or university, contact HR to make sure that the required transfer procedure can be accomplished. Comply with the US Department of State health insurance requirements for J-1 visa holders and their families. Willful disregard of these requirements will result in termination of the program and your J-1 status. Passports must be kept valid. Passports can be  renewed by the visitor's consulate in the United States.

If traveling outside of the US by the J-1 visitor and any J-2 dependents, a valid travel signature must be obtained on the Form DS-2019 to re-enter the United States. Request a travel signature from a J-1 advisor at least five days before travel begins. J-2 dependents must also have their DS-2019 forms signed. Passport, visa, and DS-2019 should be checked to ensure that they will not expire while outside the country. We recommend renewing passports that will expire within six months."

https://isso.utdallas.edu/international-student-success,Student Success - International Students and Scholars Office | The University of Texas at Dallas,Scams,Protect yourself by learning about the different types of scams that international students can encounter while inside the United States.
https://isso.utdallas.edu/international-student-success,Student Success - International Students and Scholars Office | The University of Texas at Dallas,What To Do If You Have Been Scammed,"If you believe you are a victim of a scam, you can take action to protect yourself. Stop all communication with the scammer. Change any passwords on any accounts that may be involved with the scam. Contact any financial institutions (banks, credit card companies) involved. Make a report to your local law enforcement agency. You can also contact the UT Dallas Police Department at 972-883-2222. Contact the ISSO for support. You can report immigration scams to USCIS here . You can also check the Scam Resources section below for links to report other types of scams."
https://isso.utdallas.edu/international-student-success,Student Success - International Students and Scholars Office | The University of Texas at Dallas,Types of Scams,"Students and others in the UT Dallas community have received phone calls from people claiming to work for the U.S. government. The callers can use fake caller ID information, so it appears they are calling from a U.S. government agency phone number or in this scam, a UT Dallas phone number. These calls often involve a request for students to provide personal financial information, including credit or debit card numbers, or for students to purchase gift cards to avoid being jailed/deported. U.S. government agencies like USCIS, the U.S. Department of State, and the IRS (Internal Revenue Service) would NEVER ask for your bank information or immediate payment over the phone in the form of gift cards or money orders. When a U.S. government agency wishes to reach you, they will notify you in writing before a phone call. If you do pick up a phone call and the person on the other line identifies themselves as someone who works for one of these U.S. government agencies, ask for the name of the person who you are speaking with and for their badge number. You can also ask to speak to their supervisor and their badge number as well. The ISSO can assist you in helping you identifying if the people you spoke to were from a U.S. government agency or if they were scammers. USCIS has a list of common immigration scams. We recommend you read this information so you can prepare and easily spot a scam. If you receive a suspicious email claiming to be from USCIS, you can forward to USCIS directly at USCIS.Webmaster@uscis.dhs.gov before responding. The FTC YouTube Page has many helpful videos about scams. Listen to what a scam SSN call sounds like Read the Federal Trade Commissions article about ""Scammers Go After International Students' Money"". Employment scams begin with an unsolicited job advertisement that is sent to a student's utdallas.edu email account. These emails appear to come from a professor or a legitimate employer on or off campus. The student is often told they will be paid up front for this position and they are instructed to deposit a fake check into their account. Students are told these funds are to pay for personal items or equipment needed to perform the job. What the student does not know is that the check is actually a counterfeit check and by the time their bank discovers the check is fraudulent, you have already spent your own funds for items that will never arrive or given your own money that you can never get back. It has recently been brought to our attention that one of our prospective students received an unsolicited job offer that was sent to their utdallas.edu email account. This email appeared to come from a professor at UT Dallas and the offer letter had a UT Dallas letter head. Please see the example of the offer letters the student received: Employment scams, such as this one, are prevalent among international students. Students are told they will be paid up front for this position and are instructed to deposit a fake check into their account. Students are told these funds are to pay for personal items or equipment needed to perform the job.  What the student doesn't know is that the check is actually a counterfeit check and by the time your bank discovers the check is fraudulent, you have already spent your own funds for items that will never arrive. You will also most likely never get your own money back. Below are two more employment scam emails that actual UT Dallas students have received: The Federal Trade Commission also has information on their website about employment scams . Look for unusual email addresses. No legitimate company would use a Gmail address to contact you. A UT Dallas 'professor' would use a UT Dallas email address, not a free email service. You are being offered too much money for the work being done. They want to pay you in advance. There is no job interview, you are being hired based on your LinkedIn Account/Handshake Account. Moving from one medium to another, for example: email to texting/WhatsApp Sense of haste. It is important to remember that the majority of on campus jobs are listed through the University Career Center through Handshake. If you are unsure about a job or a job offer, please contact the ISSO. We will be happy to help identify if the offer is legitimate or not.  Working without authorization can cause termination of your F-1 status. We hope this information is helpful. Thank you for choosing UT Dallas, and we look forward to supporting your success in the upcoming semester."

If your status expires before you filed an application with USCIS to change your status, or if you have otherwise violated the terms of your status, then USCIS may not approve your application. USCIS has a guide that may assist you. Be prepared in the event your application is denied. A change of status approval is not automatic. If your application is denied, you may be required to depart the United States immediately. Do not engage in activities reserved for F-1 status until after you receive notice from USCIS that your application has been approved. This includes F-1 employment such as on-campus employment or CPT. Once approved for F-1 status, you may be eligible to apply for CPT internships after you have established that you have been lawfully enrolled full-time in a U.S. university for at least one academic year (two consecutive long semesters) immediately prior to the semester in which the CPT will take place, and you have met other CPT requirements. Do not enroll in classes if your current immigration category does not allow it . Enrolling in any classes if you are B-1/B-2 is a violation of your current immigration status. Enrolling full-time if you are F-2 is a violation of your current immigration status. Even though UT Dallas will allow you to enroll and attend classes, if you are in one of the above immigration categories, you will be violating your current immigration status.

Office of Enrollment Services: If you are not lawfully permitted to study and your change of status application will not be approved in time to begin classes for the term which you were admitted, please consult the Office of Admissions and Enrollment early to determine relevant deadlines to defer your admission. UT Dallas financial award granting office: If you are not lawfully permitted to work and you received a scholarship, assistantship or other financial award, please consult with the office which extended the award to you to determine your options and relevant deadlines if the change of status application is not approved by the start of classes.

Please email documentation showing proof of your current status to IssoDocuments@utdallas.edu and OICS@utdallas.edu . Acceptable proof of your current active status includes: Copy of I-797A Approval Notice, or; Copy of most recent I-94 Your current non-immigrant status and expiration date should be visible on the document. Once your Visa Status has been updated in Orion, wait 48 hours and then try to log in to iComet again. If your status will expire more than 30 days before your requested I-20 start date, but you plan to submit a Change of Status petition to USCIS before your status expires, the ISSO can issue an I-20 for Change of Status inside the U.S. upon request. However, applying with a gap of more than 30 days between your status expiration and I-20 start date could lead to a denial. You can apply for Change of Status to F-1 while you are currently pending an extension of your current status, which may lessen the risk of denial. In this case, include a copy of your I-797 Extension receipt along with your application. However, applying for Change of Status to F-1 will likely affect the extension application of your current status. Consult an immigration attorney to understand possible risks of these scenarios before making a determination. Changing to F-1 could affect your tuition rate. F-1 students typically pay out-of-state tuition unless they are granted a scholarship or assistantship by UT Dallas, or meet the criteria for other exceptions. State residency law is separate from immigration law, and eligibility is determined by the UT Dallas office of Residency, not the ISSO. Texas Residency information is available at https://registrar.utdallas.edu/residence/ . You will need to complete the Core Residency Questionnaire as instructed on this web page to determine your eligibility for in-state tuition after changing to F-1. If you are in a non-immigrant visa category that is allowed to change to F-1, you can apply for a Change of Status to F-1 while you are pending permanent residency. However, a pending permanent residency application could be a reason for denial of a Change of Status to F-1. F-1 is a non-immigrant status, and pending permanent residency shows immigrant intent. You may be required to provide additional evidence regarding your plans and intent, such as showing you will return to your home country after completing your studies and return later as a permanent resident if approved. Applying for COS to F-1 could also impact your permanent residency application. Consult an immigration attorney before considering this option. If you are changing status outside the U.S. and your Change of Status is denied, you will not be issued an F-1 visa. If the consulate officer does not cancel your current visa and it is unexpired, then you may return to the U.S. in your present status, unless you are an aged-out dependent. If you submitted an application to USCIS, a denial notice will be sent. If you want to appeal the decision, you can file a Motion to Reconsider with the help of an immigration attorney. Unless otherwise indicated by the adjudicator, your current status remains valid if it has not expired. If your current status is expired, you may be subject to unlawful presence and removal proceedings. You must report to the ISSO as soon as you receive your change of status I-797A approval notice. You should receive a link from the ISSO by email at the start of each semester to report the status of your application, and you will report your approval in the same form. You will automatically receive a new I-20 from the ISSO once you report your approval, complete the New Student Check In steps, and ISSO successfully registers your F-1 SEVIS record. You cannot enter earlier than 30 days prior to the program start date listed on page 1 of your I-20. The ISSO does not recommend you attempt to enter after the program start date. If you attempt to enter the U.S. after the program start date listed on your I-20, port of entry officials may deny you entry. If you experience a major delay while outside the U.S., we recommend that you defer UTD admission and I-20 to a later semester. Federal regulations allow you to enroll for classes and work on-campus after receiving F-1 approval. B-1/B-2 : If the semester's Census Day has passed prior to receiving approval, you will need to defer admission to the next semester. F-2 : If your application is approved prior to the program start date, you should register full-time for that semester. If it is not approved by the program start date, you should register less than full-time for the current semester and register full-time in the semester following your Change of Status approval. H-4, E-3, etc. : If you are currently in a study-allowed status, you may enroll prior to approval. If approved, you may work on-campus up to 30 days prior to your I-20 program start date. If you have already established two consecutive spring / fall semesters of lawful full time enrollment and a UT Dallas GPA with good standing, you may begin CPT on your program start date."

You must contact the relevant offices, including the Registrar's Office, Bursar's Office, University Housing, scholarship granting office, etc. Students who request AEW will not be automatically dropped from their courses due to AEW, lack of attendance, or non-payment. Students are solely responsible for ensuring that they have successfully dropped their courses in order to avoid additional fees and charges to their account and to avoid receiving a grade of 'F' for nonattendance. Visit https://registrar.utdallas.edu/registration/ for instructions on how to drop your courses. Early withdrawal from your program may affect your academic record. We strongly advise you to check in with the following offices: Academic Department : Impact of AEW on your academic record and scholarship or assistantship if any Bursar's Office : Deadlines for refunds and payments Registrar's Office : Deadlines for dropping classes Student Health Center : Student health insurance coverage and fees"

Submit the appropriate request according to how long you were outside of the U.S. as a result of AEW. Count the time from the date you left to the date you intend to return."
https://isso.utdallas.edu/leaving-utd/withdrawal,Authorized Early Withdrawal - International Students and Scholars Office | The University of Texas at Dallas,Frequently Asked Questions,"While there are no limitations on how many times a student can receive AEW, please keep in mind that frequent AEW requests may cause additional questions from the visa officers and/or port of entry officials. For SEVIS purposes, you will be required to submit a general reason why you are leaving the U.S. No. AEW is a non-negative termination. You may request reactivation of your SEVIS record within 5 months to return to your studies in the U.S. No. SEVP may deny the request to reactivate your SEVIS record. A reactivation denial does not negatively impact your immigration status and does not indicate a status violation on your part. However, it does mean that you will need to obtain a new Form I-20 and F-1 visa in order to re-enter the U.S. and resume your studies."

If you postpone your graduation for administrative reasons such as missing the deadline to apply for graduation, this does not postpone your program completion for immigration purposes. For immigration purposes, what matters is when you complete your degree requirements, not when you receive your diploma."
https://isso.utdallas.edu/leaving-utd/graduation,Graduation and Beyond - International Students and Scholars Office | The University of Texas at Dallas,What is my program completion date?,"For most bachelor's degree candidates, the completion date is determined by the date when you complete all the courses required for your degree program and are eligible to graduate. For master's degree candidates in non-thesis programs, the completion date is determined by the date when you complete all courses required for your degree program and any other program requirements, assuming the other program requirements are completed at the earliest possible date following completion of all coursework. For master's degree candidates in thesis programs, the completion date is determined by the date when your thesis has been approved by the Graduate Dean and by your thesis committee. For doctoral degree candidates, your completion date is determined by the date when you successfully defend your dissertation or the degree conferral date for the full-term session. Only you and your academic department can determine which date will be your actual date of program completion. F-1 and J-1 students may not postpone graduation due to: Poor job market, family concerns or for other reasons unrelated to the current academic degree program. These are not reasons the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) will accept for delaying graduation, and you could be viewed as violating the regulations. Wanting to take classes that are personally interesting or important for the program of study, but that are not required to get the degree. Courses that are not required by your degree program do not allow you to postpone your graduation. Taking classes not required by your degree program which then delay graduation could be perceived by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services as a violation of your F-1 or J-1 status."
https://isso.utdallas.edu/leaving-utd/graduation,Graduation and Beyond - International Students and Scholars Office | The University of Texas at Dallas,USCIS Regulations on Postponing Graduation,"USCIS regulations clearly state that you may only maintain status by pursuing a full course of study and by making normal progress toward completing this specific course of study. A common misconception is that a student can remain in the U.S. as long as their I-20 / DS-2019 has not yet expired. This is not true. You cannot maintain your status as an F-1 or J-1 student by simply having an unexpired I-20 or DS-2019. The completion or end date listed on your I-20 (section #5) or DS-2019 (section #3) is simply an estimate of the time it takes an average student to complete the same degree or academic program. The following excerpts are taken from the F-1 regulations: "". . . .If the student is not required to take any additional courses to satisfy the requirements for completion, but continues to be enrolled for administrative purposes, the student is considered to have completed the course of study and must take action to maintain status. Such action may include applying for change of status or departure from the U.S."" (8 CFR 214.2(f)(6)(iii)(C)) "". . .an F-1 student is admitted for duration of status. Duration of status is defined as the time during which an F-1 student is pursuing a full course of studies at an education school approved by the Service for attendance by foreign students. . . . An F-1 student who has completed a course of study will be allowed an additional 60-day period to prepare for departure from the United States or prepare for transfer to a higher level at the same or another educational institution. . . .The student is considered to be maintaining status if he or she is making normal progress toward completing a course of study."" ( 8 CFR 214.2(f)(5)) Some students ask the ISSO ""How would USCIS know if I delayed my graduation?"" USCIS might never know that you postponed your graduation even though you had completed your degree program. However, we can tell you that USCIS generally performs thorough historical reviews for applicants applying for a change of status to H-1B or an adjustment of status to U.S. permanent resident. They will ask for copies of all the I-20 / DS-2019 forms which were issued to you as well as transcripts. They will scrutinize the timing of various events. Ultimately, it is up to you to decide if the risk of any action you take is worth the potential future consequences. USCIS holds you responsible for maintaining your F-1 or J-1 status – not the International Students and Scholars Office or your academic advisor. Be aware that if the ISSO has evidence or knowledge that you are attempting to postpone graduation or have already completed your studies, they will shorten your I-20 / DS-2019 and deny future extensions."

If you plan to complete your degree using priority deadlines, keep in mind that immigration regulations do not allow for F-1 and J-1 students to be unenrolled if they have not completed degree requirements. Whether or not you must enroll for your final semester with priority deadlines will depend on the date that you complete your thesis or dissertation requirements: If you complete all degree requirements before Census Day of your final semester, you are not required to enroll. You may, however, need to take some other action to maintain your status, such as applying for OPT or Academic Training. If you complete all degree requirements after Census Day of your final semester, you must still enroll for that semester to maintain your immigration status, even if you will defend prior to the degree conferral date of that semester. If you will complete all degree requirements within the first 8 weeks of the semester, you are only required to enroll in the first 8 week term. However, if you find that will not complete your degree requirements until the last 8 weeks of the semester, you must enroll in full term classes or 1 st and 2 nd 8 week classes, at least up to the date of degree requirement completion.

https://police.utdallas.edu/public-information/safety-and-security-policies/file-sexual-assault-complaint,File Sexual Assault Complaint - Police Department | The University of Texas at Dallas,File Sexual Assault Complaint,"UT Dallas encourages any person who is the victim of a forcible or non-forcible sexual offense to immediately report the incident to a campus security authority such as the University Police, Office of the Dean of Students, University residential life personnel, deans, directors, and department heads. Other university personnel who may be contacted are Student Health Services and the Counseling Center . If the assault occurred outside the UT Dallas campus, the local police department where the assault occurred should be called. UT Dallas personnel will assist in contacting the local police department if the assault occurred off campus, if requested by the victim. There is no requirement to notify law enforcement authorities of a sexual offense; however, the University encourages all victims to do so. University personnel will assist in notifying the University Police to report a sexual offense. UT Dallas Police should be notified as soon as possible. The victim should not bathe, douche, or change clothes after the assault in order to preserve evidence necessary for the proof of criminal sexual assault. If needed, contact one of the above mentioned resources or a support person for assistance. UT Dallas Police will handle all cases that occur on campus. If transportation is needed to obtain a medical examination, the University Police Department will arrange for transportation to the hospital. For the protection of the victim, a pseudonym (fictitious name) may be used in the reporting process. When a student reports that the campus regulation prohibiting sexual assault has been violated, informal procedures that provide for the protection of the emotional health and physical safety of the complainant may be invoked. For example, a student who lives on campus may be moved to another campus living environment if he or she chooses and if accommodations are reasonably available. Similarly, a complainant may be allowed to make changes in his or her class schedule. Such arrangements will be made through the Office of the Dean of Students. If the complainant provides credible evidence that the accused student has engaged in prohibited sexual assault, the dean may take interim disciplinary action against the accused student as appropriate. A student who wishes to file a complaint to be addressed by the University disciplinary system should contact the dean at 972-883-6391 . A student may choose to file a complaint with the dean whether or not the student chooses to press criminal charges. A student who wishes to file a complaint against a faculty or staff member may contact the dean as well. Procedures for discipline and dismissal of faculty and staff are outlined in the University Handbook of Operating Procedures ."

https://police.utdallas.edu/programs-and-services/uemr/ems-education/emt-class/emt-class-faq,EMT Class FAQ - Police Department | The University of Texas at Dallas,EMT Class FAQ,
https://police.utdallas.edu/programs-and-services/uemr/ems-education/emt-class/emt-class-faq,EMT Class FAQ - Police Department | The University of Texas at Dallas,Is taking an EMT Course worth it for Pre-Health Students?,"Yes! BUT there are some important considerations. Our program is one of the only programs in North Texas that caters specifically to college undergraduate students. This is really important because while there are many great programs available, they are designed for students that do not have schedules and commitments such as Pre-Health Students at a college like UTD. An EMT course is an AMAZING way to gain valuable experience during your undergraduate years, and the program is challenging but very rewarding. Pros of taking an EMT Class in College as a Pre-Health Student: The best form of patient care experience (unlike shadowing, you are actually treating patients!!) You are able to experience the true reality of healthcare and interact with patient populations that you wouldn't otherwise. Develop professional skills that you will carry into any graduate program (Medical School, PA School etc) Experience being an actual healthcare provider, and see if it is the best career for you. Are able to demonstrate to graduate programs (Medical School, PA School etc) that you had the initiative to place yourself in the healthcare environment prior to applying. Gain a great paying part-time job or be eligible to apply to volunteer with UEMR, gaining clinical hours as well. Cons of taking an EMT Class in College as a Pre-Health Student: Is a challenging class that may be overwhelming if you are taking a high course load that semester (18+ credits) It takes a considerable amount of dedication (comparable to a 4 hour credit class) Emergency Medicine may not be for everyone, but at least by taking the course you don't waste time in medical school figuring that out! If you take another non-UTD course, you may find that the schedule may clash with your UTD work. Also, you may find that the clinical rotations are a lower standard than our clinical relationships. Just a consideration when comparing other programs. As soon as you register! Your spot in the class is not confirmed until you complete payment.  You can either pay in full or use a payment plan (use the word paymentplan when you complete the registration process, and it will generate an invoice for half.) Classes fill quickly! No refunds unless authorized by the course director for extenuating circumstances. Once I finish the course, does that make me a licensed EMT? Successful completion of our course is the only way to be eligible to test for the National Registry of EMTs certification, which is a requirement for Texas EMT Licensure. Will I get College Credit for this course? Yes, if you are a UTD student and space in the HLTH4304 course allows. You are eligible to receive credit for internship courses (HLTH 4301, and others). You must have enrolled in the EMT course prior to enrolling in HLTH4304. Only those with UEMR's program staff permission may enroll in the EMT course section of HLTH4304. You will be required to pay for regular UTD tuition on top of the UEMR course tuition. HLTH4304 will go on your UTD transcript, and your grade will affect your UTD GPA. We have 2 formats. The ""Hybrid"" format means that you will complete certain aspects online then also have a required in-person lab time. A student should expect to spend anywhere from 10-15 hours per week on completing online materials. The ""Academy"" format meets every day Monday-Friday 8:30am – 4:30pm. What does my clinical rotations consist of? After successful skills testing and taking our final exam, you will be released to clinical rotations. You will complete three 12 hour Emergency Department Clinicals and one 24-hour clinical rotation with a local fire department. You will get to practice your newly learned skills on real patients! Our clinical partners include THR Plano, THR Dallas, Methodist Dallas, Medical City Dallas and Medical City Plano. Our internship partners include Richardson FD, Irving FD, Mesquite FD, Garland FD, McKinney FD, and Plano FD. Will I be eligible to apply for UEMR after the course? Yes. The only way to be eligible to apply for UEMR is to either take the UEMR EMT course or have extensive EMS experience."

Concurrent enrollment – Enroll at UT Dallas and another institution concurrently. Submit a Concurrent Enrollment Form to the UT Dallas ISSO by Census Day of each semester. Graduating semester – ""Graduating semester"" refers to the last semester of degree requirements, whether you are attending a graduation ceremony that semester or not. In your final semester, you meet full-time enrollment requirements by enrolling in all remaining courses, even if the total number of hours is less than the standard 9 or 12 credit hour requirement. To use this option you must: Be graduating from the major and degree listed on your I-20 Apply for graduation by Census Day . Enroll in at least one face-to-face course for the duration of the graduating semester. Additional courses needed to complete the degree in the graduating semester may be online, hybrid or face-to-face. Students with thesis/dissertation requirements who chose to apply for graduation by Priority Deadlines may have different enrollment requirements in their final semester. See the Graduation and Beyond page for more information about the impact of Priority Deadlines on F-1 Status. Reduced Course Load due to CPT – Graduate level students may be eligible for a Reduced Course Load authorization if they are participating in a full-time CPT that lasts at least 11 weeks. This option cannot be used in two consecutive long semesters (spring and fall), and a number of restrictions apply. See the CPT page for more details. This option is not available for undergraduate students. Reduced Course Load due to Academic or Medical Reasons – The Department of Homeland Security allows F-1 students to request a reduced course load in certain academic situations or due to medical reasons. You must submit the appropriate, signed request form and receive authorization prior to dropping below full-time enrollment. Reduced Course Load due to Thesis/Dissertation – Students who have completed all of their coursework and who are only required to enroll in a thesis/dissertation course may request a reduced course load. With this authorization, the student can enroll in fewer credit hours of the thesis/dissertation course. Students must take a minimum of 1 credit hour to maintain F-1 status. The academic department may require the student to take more than 1 credit hour to meet academic requirements. Study Abroad – Students who participate in UT Dallas-approved study abroad programs are enrolled full-time in a special UT Dallas course. Check the Education Abroad for International Students webpage for requirements and restrictions. For information about study abroad opportunities and requirements, contact Education Abroad .

https://isso.utdallas.edu/enroll-req,Enrollment Requirements - International Students and Scholars Office | The University of Texas at Dallas,F-1 Enrollment Charts,"The enrollment charts reflect the F-1 regulations and standard enrollment requirements. The temporary exception for fall 2022 changes what instruction type is acceptable, but does not change the required credit hours. SEVP defines two groups of F-1 students, with two separate enrollment requirements. F-1 students who were in Active F-1 status on March 9, 2020 can meet their full-time enrollment requirements with an entirely online course load. F-1 students who began their F-1 status after March 9, 2020 must take at least one course with in-person components each semester and should be prepared to participate in the in-person components. Students in this group must continue to enroll in at least one course with in-person components every semester. F-1 students must enroll full-time each fall and spring semester unless approved for a reduced course load. An undergraduate student enrolls in 15 credit hours, with 9 credit hours face-to-face and 6 credit hours online. This meets the enrollment requirements because the student is taking more than the minimum 12 credit hours, and at least 9 credit hours are face-to-face. A graduate student enrolls in 9 credit hours, with 3 credit hours online. This meets enrollment requirements because the student is taking the minimum required credit hours and is only counting one online course towards the required hours. Summer enrollment is optional unless it is your first semester at UT Dallas, in F-1 status, in a new program of study, or it is your graduating semester Summer enrollment is required if you are a transfer student whose first semester in the U.S. was spring, at another school, you have not completed an academic year in the U.S. and you transfer to UT Dallas for summer Summer enrollment is required if you are a transfer student whose SEVIS release date is before summer classes begin If you do not meet one of these criteria, enrollment is optional. You may take any number of classes of any instruction type, or you can take zero classes. A student who began their program of study at UT Dallas in the spring semester is considering whether to take summer classes. Summer enrollment is optional, since it is not the student's first semester in the U.S., in the program, in F-1 status, or their graduating semester. The student decides to enroll in one online course. If the student needs to drop the class later, that is okay because summer enrollment is optional. The graduating semester enrollment requirements are the same, whether you are an undergraduate student or a graduate student. ""Graduating semester"" refers to the last semester of degree requirements, whether you are attending a graduation ceremony that semester or not. You must be completing the degree and major listed on your I-20 to be eligible to enroll less than full time. Students with thesis/dissertation requirements who apply for graduation by Priority Deadlines may have different enrollment requirements in their final semester. See the Graduation and Beyond page for more information about the impact of Priority Deadlines on F-1 Status. A student is graduating in spring and has three courses remaining to finish their degree. The student can enroll in one face-to-face course and two online courses to meet their enrollment requirements. A student is graduating in fall and only has one course remaining. In order to meet the physical presence requirement for enrollment, the student enrolls in a face-to-face section of the course that lasts for the entire semester."
https://isso.utdallas.edu/enroll-req,Enrollment Requirements - International Students and Scholars Office | The University of Texas at Dallas,Online and Hybrid Courses,"The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) requires F-1 students to enroll in a minimum number of ""physical presence"" courses each semester in order to meet the full-time enrollment requirement. Students who enroll in too many distance education (online or hybrid) courses and who do not take the minimum number of ""physical presence"" hours/courses violate their F-1 status. Distance Education is defined as a course where the student receives the majority of instruction in a way other than being present in a classroom on campus. CPT and independent research courses are not considered distance education courses. If you have questions regarding what is defined as a ""physical presence"" course or other elements of the full-time enrollment requirement, contact an international student advisor . Only one distance education course can count towards the total number of required credit hours for F-1 students. If a student has only one course remaining in the last semester before graduation, that course cannot be an online course."

https://isso.utdallas.edu/enroll-req,Enrollment Requirements - International Students and Scholars Office | The University of Texas at Dallas,Impact of Withdrawals,"If a student drops below full-time enrollment without prior approval from the ISSO, their immigration status will be terminated in accordance with federal regulations. This applies to both academic and non-academic withdrawals, as well as retroactive withdrawals completed after the semester end date. Students must take care to maintain their full-time enrollment and to obtain a reduced course load authorization prior to dropping below full-time enrollment, to avoid termination of their immigration status. For retroactive withdrawals, keep in mind that reduced course load authorizations cannot be backdated or retroactively approved. If a student retroactively withdraws and falls below full-time enrollment, their immigration record will be terminated."
https://isso.utdallas.edu/enroll-req,Enrollment Requirements - International Students and Scholars Office | The University of Texas at Dallas,F-1 / J-1 Status and Physical Presence,"F-1 and J-1 students have two different but overlapping requirements to fulfill the regulations for maintaining status: Enrollment requirements (how many and what modality of credits to enroll in) Physical presence requirements (being physically present in the U.S., either on campus or at designated educational site) Per the standard enrollment requirements, a specific proportion of your classes must be face-to-face. This means that there is a regulatory expectation for you to be physically attending the face-to-face courses that you are enrolled in . You should be physically present on campus and receiving face-to-face instruction for the majority of the semester, unless you have an ISSO authorized exception (CPT, AT, RCL, etc). Note that all CPT work should also take place within the U.S. , even if the position is remote. (Please see our Travel during CPT/OPT/STEM newsletter for more information.) If you are not meeting the presence requirement at the start of the term or for a significant amount of time during the semester, you risk violating your F-1 status and losing future immigration benefits. In order to verify the physical presence of current F-1 students, the ISSO requires all continuing students to submit proof of their current presence in the U.S. before each fall and spring semester by submitting a copy of your most recent I-94 in iComet. A 'Current Student Check-in' form is launched in the iComet portal for this purpose prior to each fall and spring term. You should anticipate timely submitting your re-entry information to the ISSO and plan any travel abroad accordingly to ensure that you return prior to the start of classes . The Check In must be completed no later than Census Day to ensure your status is not endangered. ISSO manually verifies J-1 student and scholar enrollment and physical presence each semester. For F-1 students, you are unable to arrive in time to complete Current Student Check-in, or you need to depart the U.S. for the majority of the term, then you will not be able to maintain your F-1 status. In order to receive a non-negative termination of your F-1 SEVIS record, you should complete the process of Authorized Early Withdrawal , ideally before Census Day. If you are able to return to the U.S. to continue your in-person studies within 5 months of your AEW, you have a chance to re-activate your existing SEVIS record and continue your F-1 status uninterrupted. Refer to the link for more information about AEW. Not meeting all enrollment or presence requirements can result in termination. All current/ continuing F-1 students will be responsible for verifying their physical presence in the U.S. at their designated educational site each fall and spring term by completing Current Student Check-in through iComet. Your enrollment each semester must meet also all of the above criteria, including the face-to-face requirements. If the physical presence or enrollment requirements are not met by Census Day, including if you have too many online or hybrid classes in your course load, your SEVIS record could be terminated if the issue is not corrected. For J-1 students and scholars, you should refer to J-1 advising if you believe you may not be able to meet the physical presence requirements for your status: ISSOJ1@utdallas.edu"
