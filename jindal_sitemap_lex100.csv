https://execed.utdallas.edu,Executive Education at UT Dallas | Naveen Jindal School of Management,Student Testimonials,"Erinn Marks, GLEMBA ’19I searched for an online program that was a WIN-WIN. I was able to pursue my MBA and enjoy the last of the wonder years with my children. Tamer Elshamy, GLEMBA ’19Sales Director,Fawry Banking and Payment Technology ServicesAn exceptional experience mixed with both cutting edge knowledge and great personal skills improvement. Veronica Sanchez, MS LODI was initially drawn to the Master of Science in Organizational Development program by its reputation for providing deep, practical insights and fostering leadership skills in a collaborative learning environment. The program not only met but surpassed my expectations by delivering rigorous coursework that broadened my understanding and expertise in organizational development. What truly enhanced my experience, however, were the remarkable peers I learned alongside, whose perspectives continually enriched our discussions, as well as the dedicated mentors, professors, and faculty members who invested wholeheartedly in my growth.
This journey has been immensely rewarding, and I am excited to apply my skills and knowledge to continue to drive success and inspire others. Ashwin Prakash, GLEMBA ’20Head of Data Science and Analytics,HCA HealthcareThe application of learnings from Operations Management and Strategic Management courses helped make an immediate impact in my job, merging the lines between school and work while providing an instant return on investment for my employer. Vinesh ReddyVice President, Business Process Offshore,Bank of AmericaThe executive coaching experience was transformational. I was analyzed by my coach and was provided great recommendations to improve myself from where I was before the coaching to where I am now. I found the experience to be valuable to me personally and professionally. Jacob Heller, MS LODThe MSLOD program with the Strategic HR concentration gave me the knowledge and confidence to achieve my career goals. The curriculum helped me reframe how I approach business leaders daily to achieve my intended results better. The program provided both breadth and depth of understanding while also giving me the tools to dive deeper and learn more independently when needed. Andrew Svatek, EMBA 2022Director of Operations,Svatek ConsultingWhen researching EMBA programs to pursue it was clear early on that UTD’s EMBA was the perfect fit for me. The elite faculty, diversity of the program, and relevant and evolving curriculum were huge drivers in my decision and made it a no-brainer. I always anticipated an academic journey that would challenge me personally and professionally, but what I did not anticipate was the unbelievable camaraderie and support of my cohort that was established on the first day of orientation. I have learned as much from my classmates as I have from my professors, and I know I will leave UTD with lifelong friends and a world-class executive education. I am so grateful for the opportunity to earn an EMBA at UTD JSOM Holly Martin, GLEMBA ’19Customer Experience Manager,J.B. HuntBecause of this program, I was able to present within my organization to five different groups, which led to a promotion, an invitation to assist with three special projects as a new manager, and an appointment as a co-chair to lead professional development for an internal employee resource group. Khaled Hallak, EMBA 2021Bank of America, Officer,Syndicated Loan CloserI joined the EMBA program at UT Dallas with aspirations to hone my business acumen and skillsets gathered from academia and real-world experience through both entrepreneurship and large corporate ventures. The EMBA program did not polish my current understanding; they shattered my foundation and rebuilt my business knowledge with the most cutting-edge academics through a prestigious curriculum and world-renowned professors. Throughout the rigors of this program, I quickly learned the importance and power of my cohort. With an ocean of information flowing towards you, it is impossible for one person to absorb and process on their own. I formed a tight bond with some of the brightest executive minds across an array of industries. In this program, we did more than just dissect and examine case studies from historic events; we were able to consult with real corporations in efforts to aid with ongoing and current issues. Our impact was evidenced when select corporations successfully implemented our recommendations. This program is far from easy, it will push you to new heights and you will need to reintroduce yourself to your family and friends upon graduation. On the bright side, the leaders of this program, Pamela Brady (Program Director) and Connie Imhof (Program Manager), are such genuine and caring people, you will feel like a part of a new family throughout the duration of this program. If you are looking to expand your knowledge and grow your network, the EMBA at UTD comes highly recommended. Denis Zub (EMBA 2022)Just one year ago, when COVID-19 have not even appeared in top-1000 Google searches and flying anywhere on Earth was a five-minute decision, I was sitting in my chair thinking of the next career steps. The only thing I knew then was that I needed inspiration, rethinking, rebooting if you will. Boiling in your day-to-day problems, solving your pre-determined pattern of tasks, and being eventually stuck in your narrow life-box with a boring forward-looking prospect was not the life I wanted to live. Thomas Rodgers (EMBA 2022)The Executive MBA program has been a fantastic experience, and the cohort has become more than just a group of students taking a class together- we have become friends that can lean on each other and help our fellow cohort members no matter what. Aside from the incredibly talented faculty and staff, the networking opportunities have been invaluable. I know the connections that I’m making with this cohort will last and benefit my career well into the future. The curriculum has been curated to be relevant and useful for today’s business environment. The academic experience has been challenging and is one of the myriad reasons why I would recommend this program to anyone considering an MBA. Michelle Miller, EMBA 2015Research Operations Manager,CBREThe executive coaching experience was very helpful in guiding my understanding of my strengths and weaknesses and helping me build a plan to leverage them or overcome them, respectively. My executive coach and I continued to work together after the structured part of the program was over as my coach’s expertise in career transitions was very helpful as I evaluated, negotiated, and executed my next career move. David GillAfter much engineering and product development experience in the semiconductor/electronic product space, I found this program to be exceptional for enriching my knowledge of the full product lifecycle. The curriculum was well balanced, engaging and formatted so individual benefits from their own studies as well as others’ perspectives through group interaction. The program is not limited to the boundaries of sourcing and purchasing but rather includes the study and tools for management of the complete product lifecycle. I have a much-improved understanding of operational considerations and a complete tool set to utilize because of the PLSCM program. It has greatly increased my contribution and success in executing my responsibilities. Sean Seabrook, MS LODThe UTD MS in Leadership and Organizational Development is a transformative experience. The coaching certificate provides leading industry training for coaching and the ICF exam, and the organizational consulting certificate gave me practical tools and resources to develop a consulting practice. The MS degree gave me the knowledge to grow as leader and drive change in today’s fast-moving business environment. Professors in the program have corporate backgrounds, bridging academic theory with practical application, and the program is accredited in a business school which also enhances its value and the learning experience. The program expanded my network and I’ve made some life-long friends along the way. The value and experience is outstanding! Curtis ClarkMy experience during the Supply Chain EMBA program was very rewarding, both professionally and personally. I experienced a terrific camaraderie with my fellow classmates who shared a desire to learn. Dr. Rajamani has a passion for what he teaches and for helping students realize the difference they can make in the workplace. With students from many different industries and cultural backgrounds, I was able to broaden my perspective on the global nature of supply chains. I made this investment in myself. Mohammed Omer, GLEMBA ’19It’s about the experiences of exchanging skill sets and perspectives. Jake Henne, EMBA 2021World Wide Technology, Client ManagerSLEDAs a military veteran who spent 7 years as an active duty Army officer, serving exclusively in light infantry units, I had a lot to learn as I transitioned to civilian life in June 2018. I undertook immense self-study and networking primarily via LinkedIn, but I ultimately knew that I would need to refine my business skills and prove myself. Earning an MBA was always something I was interested in, even while on active duty. However, after leaving the Army, that desire heightened immensely. I was fortunate to be accepted in to the UTD EMBA program and will be forever grateful. It has been challenging in many ways, but I have learned so much about how to think about and analyze the bigger picture, and how to communicate and collaborate with professionals from all walks of life. As a type-A personality, the EMBA program has truly challenged me to get out of my comfort zone and grow both personally and professionally. #UTD #UTDEMBA #Veteran #JSOM Qiana LevyUTDs EMBA program has surpassed my expectations. The program allowed me to maintain a demanding work schedule alongside a rigorous course load. The caliber of the professors and students, and the alignment of the course materials was exceptional. The program was well-designed and added immense value to my professional growth. Immeasurable components included the executive projects, international trip, collaboration and rich discussions with like-minded professionals. The curriculum enriched my business acumen, strategic foresight/execution, relationship-building and change management skills, as well as created enduring friendships. I am deeply appreciative and highly recommend UTDs EMBA program. Ellie ShollenbergerThe UT Dallas Product Lifecycle & Supply Chain Management is a unique and one of a kind Executive MBA program; no other school offers this concentration. Unlike the traditional EMBA with a finance focus, this program taught me the importance of making the best business decision beyond the numbers. The knowledge and experience I gained in the program has given me more opportunities to be involved with important projects and to manage corporate programs in the company; and I am enjoying this challenge. Most importantly, I learned a lot from my highly experienced classmates with different backgrounds, and the friendships we built during our international study trip is a lifetime gift and priceless! Tu HuynhThe Executive MBA in Product Lifecycle in Supply Chain Management has been a tremendous value for me. The knowledge and insights that I gained from the program have helped me be confident in evaluating new business opportunities and understanding supply chain risks in order to maximize the return on investment on our project portfolio. The Executive MBA in PLSCM improved my ability to make many critical decisions for my role in the Digital Business Transformation Office where I am interfacing with many business partners and suppliers on behalf of Comerica Bank."

Neurodiversity describes the idea that people experience and interact with the world around them in many different ways; there is no one “right” way of thinking, learning and behaving, and differences are not viewed as deficits. The word neurodiversity refers to the variety of all people, but it is often used in the context of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as well as other neurological or developmental conditions such as ADHD or learning disabilities."

https://jindal.utdallas.edu/student-resources/study-abroad-programs/,Study Abroad and International Internships | Naveen Jindal School of Management,Frequently Asked Questions - Study Abroad,"How early should I apply for an exchange program?JSOM recommends that students begin considering their exchange program a year in advance and apply for a program six months in advance. See theEducation Abroaddeadlines for more detailed information.What are the costs of participating in an Exchange Abroad program?The student will pay UTD tuition, education abroad application fee, airfare, visa fees, and general living expenses. Consult with the JSOM Abroad Office for more information.I have applied online. Now what?Look for an email fromjsomabroad@utdallas.eduand the Education Abroad office. As part of the online application, you must meet with a member of the JSOM Study Abroad Team.What are the different ways students can study abroad?Exchange, International internship and Faculty-led tripDo Global Business students have to study abroad?Yes. International experience is required for Global Business majors and can be fulfilled with a semester-long exchange abroad program, an international internship or a JSOM faculty-led trip.I am not a Global Business student. Can I still study abroad?Yes.Can I complete my study abroad and my internship requirements at the same time?Yes. The Global Business majors may fulfill their study abroad requirement (international experience) by completing an international internship.What semester is the best for studying abroad?The ideal time to study abroad is the second semester of sophomore year. NO undergraduate or graduate student can participate in an exchange program during their last two semesters at UTD. However, students can participate in faculty-led trip courses and international internships during their last two semesters, but it is not recommended.I am a fast-track student. What are the requirements?Fast-track students cannot study abroad during the last two semesters of their undergraduate career.If a student only has 2 (or fewer) semesters left, but they need to complete a study abroad requirement, what should they do?The student should consider enrolling in a faculty-led trip if available or consider an international internship.What are the UTD scholarships for study abroad?Yes. JSOM students have two ways to apply for study abroad scholarships at UTD. The International Education Fund Scholarship (IEFS) and the JSOM Travel Scholarship.Will my scholarships, such as the Academic Excellence Scholarship (AES), still apply even if I spend a semester abroad for an exchange program?Yes. If the student meets all the scholarship GPA and enrollment requirements, the scholarship they received for attending UTD will still apply.How do I get course credit for courses I took during a semester exchange program?Before students leave for a semester exchange, they are required to fill out a Foreign Course Articulation Form (FCAF) signed by their Associate Dean and the JSOM Study Abroad Office. All courses taken while studying abroad MUST apply to students’ majors, and students are advised that the more classes they have taken at UTD, the fewer options they will have to choose from at their exchange university. Students should be aware that pre-approval does not guarantee enrollment.Will my exchange program delay my graduation?It depends. You should have no trouble graduating on time if you participate in an exchange program early in your academic career. However, because every student has different credits and a unique degree plan, you should schedule an appointment with the JSOM advising office (jsomugadvising@utdallas.edu) and walk through your degree plan.Are all the exchange programs on the Education Abroad website available to JSOM students?Be careful. UTD has many exchange agreements with business schools worldwide, and these universities reserve a certain number of spots specifically for JSOM students. While JSOM students are welcome to apply for a UTD exchange program at a non-business school, they should be aware that these programs are competitive, and some schools will have very few courses available that will apply to a student’s degree plan.Are there any summer exchange programs?No. Instead, students should treat this as an affiliated (third-party) partner program, even if they study at one of our partner institutions. Students should still be able to receive academic credit if they take courses from an accredited institution. JSOM recommends the London School of Economics Summer School if students are looking to study abroad during the summer.If I find an international internship, do I still need to apply to study abroad?Yes. For international internships, students must apply through the company, complete an application through the Comets Abroad Portal and report their internship in Galaxy (Orion).Are international internships paid?International internships are largely unpaid.If I cancel my faculty-led trip application, will I get a refund?No. Once the student has been accepted and enrolled in this course, the student is NOT ELIGIBLE for a refund. If the student cannot participate, they will still be required to pay the full program fee.Can alumni or spouses of current students participate in a faculty-led trip course?Yes. Alumni and spouses are allowed to participate in the trip portion of faculty-led trips. However, they must pay all fees and complete all waivers and pre-departure activities required for participation. They cannot accompany the class to any meetings or company visits.How will I be charged the program fee for a faculty-led trip?The full program fee will be added as a course fee to your student/bursar’s account.What does it mean to study abroad through an affiliated (third-party) partner program?Students interested in studying for a semester abroad may choose an exchange or affiliated partner program. An affiliated partner program is a program in which JSOM has an agreement on file with either a host institution or a third-party provider that allows JSOM to send students to that program. Unlike the exchange program, it is a one-way relationship. JSOM sends students to them, but they do not send students to JSOM. Therefore, students do not pay UTD tuition for the opportunity. They typically pay a comprehensive program fee directly to the institution or provider. JSOM does not recommend third-party programs as the cost is very high, and the courses taken are not guaranteed to transfer back."

https://jindal.utdallas.edu/student-resources/assistantships/,Graduate Assistantships | Naveen Jindal School of Management,FAQ,"I am a new incoming student. Can I apply for a TA/RA assistantship?No, you are not eligible. One of the requirements is to have a minimum UTD GPA of 3.400 that you have not earned yet. However, you are welcome to apply for employment the following semester.Can I do an internship and be a TA during the same semester?No.What is the selection process?TA assignments are determined by the hiring program based on the needs of the department and faculty. The hiring departments review all applications and select applicants based on several criteria, including the highest number of credit hours completed, highest GPA earned and academic performance in UTD courses. For example, an applicant who has completed 15 semester credit hours with a 3.900 GPA has priority over an applicant who has completed nine semester credit hours with a 3.900 GPA.When does my TA/RA assistantship start?You are not a TA/RA until the UTD HR completes all hiring paperwork.Do I get in-state tuition?The out-of-state, non-Texas resident or international students with an F1 visa are eligible for the in-state tuition work for 20 hours per week.When do I get paid?Your salary will be deposited into your account at the end of each month. However, depending on when you completed your hiring paperwork and the cut-off date for the payroll, you may not receive your first paycheck. Instead, you would receive it the following month.This semester, I am a TA/RA. Do I get my assistantship again next semester?No, you must apply online again each semester. The assistantship is not automatically renewed, and prior employment does not guarantee nor warrant any subsequent appointment.This semester, I am a TA/RA, and I got an internship (or a job offer). Can I leave?No. You must not seek an internship and/or a job placement while being a TA/RA. If you leave, the implications on faculty and hundreds of students are significant because you leave them with no support. Also, if you received an in-state tuition, it will be revoked immediately, and you must refund UTD as well.Is my TA/RA employment a binding contract?Yes, your employment is binding. Remember, a government-funded university hires you.What should I do if I have an issue with the faculty?You must meet and discuss any possible issues with the faculty directly. Most often, straightforward communication with the faculty would resolve the issue. Contact the Area Coordinator of the class to which you are assigned if there are unresolved issues with your assigned faculty member.Do I need to attend any TA/RA orientations?Yes, the TA/RA employment requires two specific orientations: 1)UTD Office of Graduate Studiesand 2) JSOM graduate office. It is your responsibility to attend both orientations as stated in the requirements. Otherwise, you will be dropped from the assistantship (no exceptions). This also means that you must change your personal travel plans, if any, to ensure you can attend both orientations. Orientations are in-person, and in some situations, they might be online."

For the healthcare workers, women in treatment, and under-served communities we serve, it all starts with YOU.”? Some of our greatest volunteers are students. They consistently show up and ask ‘What else can I do?’ Our hope is to continue to partner with UTD to reach more women, not only locally but also across the nation, to deliver comforting and life-saving services when they need it most—now. Allison Byrd HaleyExecutive Director/Founder,Heavenly MimiHeavenly Mimi is a non-profit organization helping through the cancer journey. UTD students have been such an asset to Heavenly Mimi. The knowledge they bring to help us grow, is amazing. They go the extra mile to help us with any project we give them. Marcus BakerSr. Manager of Donor Strategy,North Texas Food BankWorking with a ProConnect Reach student team was a great experience for the North Texas Food Bank. Tasked with performing a cost-benefit analysis for investing in new software for our matching gifts program, the student team took great responsibility for their work knowing their recommendations could provide a big boost in new revenue. I was impressed with their commitment to the program and the time they spent learning about our organization. This ultimately helped with their final recommendation as it was based on research of similar organizations, industry trends, and revenue forecasts using existing donor data. It was a win-win experience participating in the UT Dallas ProConnect Reach program. Courtney CuthbertDirector of Volunteers and Food MinistryBrother Bill’s Helping HandFrederick Buechner once said: ‘The place where God calls you is the place where your deep gladness and the world’s deep hunger coincide.’ Never have I felt God’s calling so clear and the coinciding of my gladness and the world’s hunger more than I do at Brother Bill’s Helping Hand. Working among the poor and the marginalized in our city has truly enhanced my life and the way I see and understand the world. I have never seen greater generosity than I have in my seven years at BBHH. When both the served and the ones serving participate in a mutual exchange because both believe they have something of value to give to the other, barriers are broken, and real relationships are formed. Olivia RogersVice President and Chief Nursing OfficerVNAAt VNA, we have a wide variety of opportunities for volunteers, from working directly with patients to sewing and administrative projects. During the COVID-19 crisis, volunteers are a life-line to patients and family care-givers who may feel more isolated."

Nationally, healthcare spending is approaching $4 trillion, representing almost 20 percent of the Gross Domestic Product. In the North Texas region alone, healthcare spending is estimated at $52 billion. Hospitals, clinics, research, ambulatory care, post-acute care and fiscal intermediaries are all part of this. As a growing industry, healthcare demands a more purposeful and integrated approach to workforce preparation and education. North Texas hospitals and hospital systems are large employers, creating over 240,000 jobs and injecting billions of dollars into the economy through employee salaries, retail sales and sales taxes. Hospitals provide jobs for an immense range of skill levels with opportunities for upward mobility in the profession."

The CHLM coordinates and synchronizes the school’s five healthcare management academic programs. BS in Healthcare ManagementThe program provides a foundation in the healthcare field while teaching business acumen that produces industry-ready graduates for entry-level management positions.MS in Healthcare Leadership and ManagementThe program provides graduate-level education to prepare industry leaders with a solid foundation in business analysis and exposure to real-world healthcare management.Executive MS/MBA in Healthcare Leadership and Management (for physicians)This cohort program provides critical knowledge, skills and academic credentials for physicians who have moved into a leadership role in their hospital, health system, group practice or professional organization. Executive MS in Healthcare Leadership and Management (for professionals)This new graduate program provides healthcare professionals with five or more years of healthcare or similar industry experience with insights and tools needed to emerge as healthcare leaders, developing the necessary skills to master strategic planning and executive leadership roles in any organization.Organizationally-tailored MS and EMBA Degree Programs for Healthcare OrganizationsSince 2011, the Organizational Behavior and Coaching Program has partnered with major healthcare systems to offer cohort-based, organization-specific degree programs.Read MoreSpecifically, large healthcare organizations are able to sponsor an Executive MBA or MS degree program in healthcare organization leadership that is customized to fit the unique needs and issues specific to their organization. For instance, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Texas Health Resources, and Parkland Health and Hospital System have sponsored such a program to provide a formal business education as well as leadership development to their leaders and high-potential employees.Cohorts are hand-selected by the senior leadership of the organization from a list of applicants, who are then invited to attend this elite program. To accommodate the demanding schedules of these busy professionals, classes are delivered using a blended learning approach that combines on-site intensives with online learning technology. This blended delivery model guarantees both quality and convenience.To ensure organizational relevance, the subject matter taught in both degree programs draws from illustrations and case studies specific to the sponsoring organization. At UT Southwestern Medical Center, for example, the knowledge and skills needed to measure and improve the quality of both clinical and patient service processes are taught using UT Southwestern data and quality initiatives. Senior leaders within the organization join the teaching faculty within their area of specialty to provide an organizationally relevant context for all subjects during on-site intensives. Prior to graduating, students are required to participate in capstone projects to utilize what they have learned during their degree program to solve actual organizational problems or issues deemed important by the senior management team who initially selected the students.Finally, students are assigned executive coaches to help them develop as professionals and apply what is being taught to their specific work situations.  Coupled with a graduate-level education, organizationally-relevant application and an integrated executive coaching component, graduates are able to make a value-added contribution to their sponsoring organization while enhancing their educational credentials.Robert Hicks, PhDDirector, Organizational Behavior and Executive Coaching Programrobert.hicks@utdallas.edu|(972)-883-5900|JSOM 1.920"

https://jindal.utdallas.edu/centers-of-excellence/fd-tech-center/,Center for the Management of Financial and Digital Asset Technologies - Naveen Jindal School of Management | The University of Texas at Dallas,Vision,"In the year 2030, the Jindal School is a global research leader in the management of Financial and Digital Asset Technologies. Financial and Digital Asset Technologies will reshape financial services and digital asset management over the next two decades. The emergence of new financial services, digital asset management and the corresponding digital economy will be the most significant and disruptive trends. Our vision for the center is the creation of applied knowledge to manage financial and digital asset technologies. Besides creating significant value for end-consumers, financial and digital asset technologies will impact financial institutions (e.g., banks), capital markets and regulatory bodies. Data will become a key asset for individuals and institutions. We will see the disintermediation of traditional intermediaries (such as banks and stock exchanges) by nimble Fintechs that will be service-oriented rather than the supply-driven model of traditional financial companies. This reintermediation will deliver more value at higher efficiency by exploiting new information technologies (such as blockchain, Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, machine learning and others). A key competitive advantage of future financial services firms will be their ability to manage and monetize data as assets. There will be a shift in the core business models of firms in this sector from financial arbitrage to information arbitrage. Financial and Digital Asset technologies will rapidly change how financial data is disseminated, processed, analyzed and traded. The innovation will be radical and fundamental. It will disrupt the modes of financial payment, funding, lending, investing, trading, financial services and ultimately the speed of financial transactions."
