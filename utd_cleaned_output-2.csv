The T-Spot test must be administered and interpreted in the United States by a licensed medical provider. International students who do not complete a TB screening or who do not submit the appropriate documentation will not be allowed to register for classes. Please bring a picture ID: passport, driver's license or state ID. Being granted the resident tuition rate does not exempt an international student from this requirement."
https://studenthealthcenter.utdallas.edu/resources/tuberculosis-immunization,Tuberculosis Screening - Student Health Center | The University of Texas at Dallas,T-Spot Test from the Student Health Center,"The T-Spot test is available on-campus through the Student Health Center for $150. This fee will be applied to your student account. You will pay the fee when you pay other charges you may owe the University after you register for classes. If you receive the T-Spot test prior to the semester for which you will be attending UT Dallas, you will be responsible for the charges the same day you receive your test. If you have questions, please call the Student Health Center at 972-883-2747 . If you are a new international student, please contact the Student Health Center to make an appointment for the T-spot test. Be sure you eat before you are tested. Make sure you are hydrated; drink lots of water on the day of your test. Let the medical provider know if you are allergic to latex. Your TB hold will be released by 8:00 a.m. the following day after the T-Spot (TB screening) test has been administered. At this time you will be able to register for classes. Results of the T-Spot test will be available 4 business days after the test is administered. If  your T-Spot result is positive, you will be contacted by the Student Health Center. A hold will be placed on your student account until you follow up with the Student Health Center and have received the additional required testing/screenings. During this time, you will not be allowed to continue attending your classes. Failure to comply may result in disciplinary action. The hold may prevent you from registering for future classes, receiving your grades, and possibly receiving your degree."

https://studenthealthcenter.utdallas.edu/student-services/sexual-assault-nurse-examination,Sexual Assault Nurse Examination | Student Health Center | UTD,Sexual Assault Nurse Examination,"Students, faculty or staff who have experienced a sexual assault may choose to access a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (S.A.N.E.) at the SHC at no charge. The exam is offered through a partnership with Turning Point Rape Crisis Center . Someone from Turning Point will complete the exam in the SHC during business hours, Monday through Thursday, 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. and Friday 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. If you need an exam outside of SHC hours, call Turning Point to arrange a time. Choosing to have a S.A.N.E. does not mean you have to report the assault to law enforcement. The exam can only occur within the first 120 hours (five days) after a sexual assault with police involvement and 96 hours (four days) without police involvement. The non-report option preserves the evidence for two years, during which time a survivor can make the decision about whether to report the assault. If you choose to have a S.A.N.E. at the SHC, nothing about the assault or exam will be added to your health record unless there is a need for you to see a SHC provider due to a physical injury, in which case your privacy is protected by state and federal law. Due to legal requirements, a report will be submitted to the university, which would contain anonymous, non-identifying information about the assault. This is not the same as informing or filing a report with the police. If you are uncertain about whether to pursue a S.A.N.E., consider the following support options: The Turning Point Hotline (available 24/7): 800-886-7273 . 24-hour Rape Crisis Hotline: 972-641-7273 . Student Health Center Nurse Advice Line (available 24/7): 972-883-2747 . Student Counseling Center : 972-883-2575 .

If you have already done any of these things, it's okay; you can still have the exam. Medical care. Medicines to prevent infection and/or pregnancy. Discussion about the assault.

https://studenthealthcenter.utdallas.edu/student-services/oral-health,Oral Health | Student Health Center | UT Dallas,Oral Health,"Like many areas of the body, your mouth is teeming with bacteria, although most of them are harmless. Normally, the body's natural defenses and good oral healthcare, such as daily brushing and flossing, can keep these bacteria under control. However, without proper oral hygiene, bacteria can reach levels that might lead to oral infections, such as tooth decay and gum disease. Studies also suggest that oral bacteria and the inflammation associated with periodontitis, which is a severe form of gum disease, might play a role in some diseases. In addition, certain diseases, such as diabetes and HIV/AIDS, can lower the body's resistance to infection, making oral health problems more severe. Your oral health might be affected by or contribute to various diseases and conditions including: Cardiovascular disease. Some research suggests that heart disease, clogged arteries and stroke might be linked to the inflammation and infections that oral bacteria can cause. Pregnancy and birth. Periodontitis has been linked to premature birth and low birth weight. Diabetes. Diabetes reduces the body's resistance to infection, putting the gums at risk. Gum disease appears to be more frequent and severe among people who have diabetes. Research also shows that people who have gum disease have a harder time controlling their blood sugar levels. HIV/AIDS. Oral problems, such as painful mucosal lesions, are common in people with HIV/AIDS. Alzheimer's disease. Tooth loss before age 35 might be a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Other conditions. Other conditions that might be linked to oral health include Sjogren's syndrome, an immune system disorder that causes dry mouth, and eating disorders."

All group members are encouraged to discuss potential situations that could impact a Group Leader's decisions while going through the Sign Up process. This could range from floorplans, to building preference, to what to do if housing is not available for the entire group.

The room selection time is the date and time applicants will be able to select their room or apartment as a Group Leader or as an individual. In the event that all available rooms are selected during the Room Self-Selection window, students or roommate groups who were not able to select a room during the Room Self-Selection period will be added to a waiting list for housing. As spaces become available, housing offers will be based on the original priority number of the individual student. Separate waiting lists for different floorplans will not be maintained. If a student declines or does not respond to an offer for housing, their Sign Up Application will be canceled and they will be removed from the waiting list.

Once the individual resident or group's room selection time starts, the Room Self-Selection management page will be made viewable on the Sign Up Application. It is the responsibility of the Group Leader to assign all residents within the roommate group to a space. All group members should verify that they have been assigned to a room by their Group Leader. If the Group Leader does not assign individuals to a space, those individuals will be able to access the page and assign themselves. Residents are not assigned to a space until the Group Leader or individual has confirmed the space. Residents will receive an automated email once their space has been assigned. Specific instructions for selecting a space will be made available on the MyHousing site during the Sign Up period."
https://housing.utdallas.edu/returning-resident-application,Returning Resident Application - University Housing | The University of Texas at Dallas,,"Renewal is the process that allows spring 2025 University Village and Canyon Creek Heights residents to guarantee their same room for the upcoming summer and academic year. Residents in Canyon Creek Heights North first-floor 2×2 units are not eligible for Renewal. Residents must sign a housing agreement that includes the summer 2025 term to be eligible for Renewal. Sign Up is the process that allows current University Housing residents who did not go through Renewal to apply for one of the remaining housing spaces available for the upcoming academic year. Please see the Renewal and Sign Up sections of this webpage for further information. Renewal takes place from 10 a.m. on Tuesday, Jan. 21 until 5 p.m. on Friday, Jan. 24. Sign Up takes place from 10 a.m. on Monday, Feb. 3 through mid-March. There are multiple steps in the Sign Up process. Please see the Sign Up section for further details. Spring 2025 University Village and Canyon Creek Heights residents, with the exception of Canyon Creek Heights North first-floor 2×2 residents, are eligible for Renewal and have priority to guarantee their same space for the upcoming 2025 summer term and 2025-2026 academic year. Sign Up priority follows the procedures outlined under the process for Sign Up . Sign Up priority is not based on the date or time stamp of the Intent to Sign Up Application. Yes. Your roommate group's averaged number will become your new priority number. Housing availability is dependent upon the number of residents who participate in the Renewal and Sign Up processes. Housing is not guaranteed for those who participate in Sign Up. However, residents who complete the Renewal process are guaranteed housing. It is impossible to know year-to-year which students will decide to participate in Sign Up and which will not. To make sure there is a consistent priority level process each year, University Housing sets ranges on priority levels to ensure that there are more than enough priority numbers within a range to accommodate all residents who may need to fit within that range. You will only be able to renew your space if you are a current University Village or Canyon Creek Heights resident and sign a housing agreement for the upcoming summer 2025 term and 2025-2026 academic year. As a reminder, residents in Canyon Creek Heights North first-floor 2×2 floorplans are not eligible for Renewal. Residents in roommate groups will be given the same room selection time. The Group Leader will be responsible for selecting all rooms for the roommate group. If the Group Leader does not place a member of the group in a space, that individual will be able to assign themselves. Depending on your group's selection time, a space for all members of the group may not be available, so the residents may need to select from the remaining available spaces. All updates will be sent to residents' UT Dallas email accounts. Residents who have not received expected communication may contact housing@utdallas.edu . Residents who renew their current room will guarantee their space once they sign their housing agreement. Residents who participate in Room Self-Selection and choose a space in University Village or Canyon Creek Heights will receive a housing assignment during the Room Self-Selection process. Residents who miss the Renewal or Sign Up process and complete the New Resident Application will be emailed housing offers based on housing availability and the preferences they listed in their housing application. If the student accepts a housing offer and signs their housing agreement, their housing assignment will be emailed to them in July. If you are on the Sign Up waitlist, we encourage you to seek off-campus housing . Students on the waitlist will receive a housing offer as we receive cancellations after the completion of the Sign Up process. Offers will be based on the resident's original priority number. University Housing will make every attempt to place requested roommates together; however, roommate requests are never guaranteed. There are multiple situations where University Housing may not be able to place requested roommates together, including, but not limited to, availability, floorplan preferences, timing of the housing offer, etc. Students who wish to cancel their housing may submit the cancellation request form in the MyHousing portal. Fees may apply based on the date of cancellation. If a resident completes a Renewal Application and cancels their spring 2025 housing or the 2025-2026 Renewal Application after the conclusion of the Renewal process, the summer 2025, fall 2025, and spring 2026 assignments will be canceled and the resident will need to move out of their space no later than May 17, 2024 at 12 p.m. or 48 hours after cancellation notice is given (if after May 11). Cancellation fees will apply. If a resident completes a Sign Up Application and cancels their spring 2025 housing, they are no longer eligible for the 2025-2026 Sign Up Application and their application will be canceled. The student will then need to apply for housing through the New Resident Application which opens on Mar. 24, 2025 (tentative) and will need to pay the $100 administrative fee. The application status can be viewed in the MyHousing portal by clicking on, ""Housing Application"" and ""Application Summary."" There are no fees associated with the Renewal or Sign Up Applications. Residents who wish to reside on campus but did not complete either Renewal or Sign Up may fill out a New Resident Application. The New Resident Application requires a $100 non-refundable housing administration fee. There are no fees associated with the Renewal or Sign Up Applications. If a New Resident Application is completed, the $100 housing administration fee is non-refundable. No. Summer housing is reserved for students who have secured housing for the 2025-2026 academic year.

https://studenthealthcenter.utdallas.edu/student-services,Student Services | Student Health Center | UT Dallas,Patient Visits,"A physical exam is a routine check your primary care provider (PCP) performs to assess your overall health. A PCP may be a doctor, a nurse practitioner or a physician assistant. The exam is also known as a wellness check. You don't have to be sick to request an exam. The physical exam can be a good time to ask your PCP questions about your health or discuss any changes or problems that you have noticed. There are different tests that may be performed during your physical exam. Depending on your age or medical or family history, your PCP may recommend additional testing. A physical examination helps your PCP to determine the general status of your health. The exam also gives you a chance to talk to them about any ongoing pain or symptoms that you're experiencing or any other health concerns that you might have. A physical exam is recommended at least once per year, especially in people over the age of 50. Annual physical exams are used to: • Check for possible diseases so they can be treated early. • Identify any issues that may become medical concerns in the future. • Ensure that you are maintaining a healthy diet and exercise routine . • Build a relationship with your PCP. Before meeting with your PCP, a nurse will ask you a series of questions about your medical history, including any allergies, past surgeries or symptoms you might have. They may also ask about your lifestyle, including if you exercise, smoke or drink alcohol . Your PCP will usually begin the exam by inspecting your body for unusual marks or growths. You may sit or stand during this part of the exam. Next, they may have you lie down and will feel your abdomen and other parts of your body. When doing this, your PCP is inspecting the consistency, location, size, tenderness and texture of your vital organs. Your PCP will use a stethoscope to listen your heart and lungs, to make sure there are no abnormal sounds . Your PCP also will check your height, weight and pulse (including whether your pulse is too slow or too fast ). A genital exam is a part of the routine physical exam. For females, the genital exam is done as a part of the women's annual exam. While you can always contact your PCP as needed, your physical exam is your time to ask questions about anything health related. If you don't understand any test that your PCP is doing, don't hesitate to ask questions. After the appointment, you are free to go about your day. Your PCP may follow up after the exam via phone call or email. They will generally provide you with a copy of your test results and carefully review your report. Your PCP will point out any problem areas and tell you steps you should take to help yourself, if needed. Depending on what your PCP finds, you may need other tests or screenings later. If no additional tests are needed and no health problems arise, you are set until next year"

If you are looking for something that is more short term, relaxed, and more just for fun, with the opportunity to play multiple sports than Intramural Sports is the option. Start your own club! Your first step to starting any new student organization and/or club is to get the group registered with the UTD Student Org Center (SOC) as a registered student organization. Once your student group is registered and you complete their orientation training, then the SOC staff will be able to help guide you in requesting facility space around the UTD Campus and connect you with our UREC Facility & Operations staff to potentially schedule your group on our facility schedule. From there your group, and advisor, can contact our office to review and begin the UREC Prospective Club Sport process to become an official UTD Club Sport sponsored by the UREC Department. Be aware that our prospective club process will take 2 year or more to complete, that includes a three-phase plan, transfers in club leadership, and organizational benchmarks, all while maintaining good organizational status with the SOC office and university partners. That is up to each and every club. Each club has their own guidelines and requirements for its members in order to be a part of the club. That varies by club. Most clubs collect semesterly/yearly membership dues to be a part of the club. Since these are student lead and run organizations, it is up to the clubs to get raise the funds they need in order to run their club, many times these funds are used to help compete, buy uniforms, purchase equipment, and other needs of the club. Reaching out to the officers of each club that you are interested in can help you to determine which club fits your budget."

Slacklining is a practice in which a participant walks across a tensioned length of nylon webbing, intended for climbing, slacklining or similar load-bearing purposes. The webbing runs parallel to the ground and is affixed firmly at each end. It is brought to tension by a responsible individual with either a pulley system or a purpose-specific ratchet. Any such activity practiced on UTD grounds or with UTD property is regulated by the following policy. Any person walking a slackline, or any person setting up or taking down a slackline, assumes inherent risks. Such risks may include, but are not limited to, injury, paralysis and death. Participants take full responsibility for both following these guidelines and using their slacklining equipment safely. Any slackline is to be affixed by a knowledgeable operator. Furthermore, it is to be set up strictly on a temporary basis. When not in use, the slackline must be taken down. Equipment will be removed without notice and stored by University Recreation, if abandoned. Slacklines may only be affixed from dawn until dusk; darkness is not a suitable condition for safe practice. Slacklines are available for free check out at the control desk in the Activity Center. A valid photo ID is needed to check out a slackline. The slackline equipment kit comes with the line, ratchet, ratchet cover and instructions for assembly, anchoring and dismantling. Inspection of the equipment kit will be conducted before check out and after return. Users may be held responsible for any damages to equipment. It is the sole responsibility of the participant to ensure all personal equipment is maintained properly and kept in working condition. Using equipment that is not maintained or regularly inspected may increase one's risk while practicing the sport. It is strongly recommended that any participant have a spotter. The only anchors to which slacklines may be attached on campus are the wooden slacklining poles located south of the Activity Center and Lot J, and just north of the varsity softball field. University Recreation and UTD Police reserve the right to enforce this policy, for both the safety of others and the functionality of the University. Disregarding or disobeying this policy may result in violations of the student code of conduct or criminal charges. No more than one person may walk on a slackline at any given time. No running on the slackline at any time. An unweighted slackline may not rest higher than 3 feet off the ground. Slacklines may not exceed 35 feet in length. Buildings, light posts, fence posts, bike racks, benches, trees or other such unapproved anchors may not be used. The only suitable anchors are the wooden slacklining poles located south of the Activity Center and Lot J, and just north of the varsity softball field. A participant may not be under the influence of alcohol or drugs. To do so assumes great risk. Slacklines may only be strung above grass and dirt. A slackline is never to be set up that crosses over, or passes within 15 feet of a sidewalk, paved walkway, road, or similar surface that carries pedestrian, bicycle, or automobile traffic. Stunts or tricks involving flips are strictly prohibited. UTD reserves the right to direct that any slackline equipment be taken down immediately, for any reason. All rental equipment is available to current UTD students and University Recreation members upon presentation of an active Comet Card. Non-members are not permitted to check out equipment.

Intramural Sports staff may conduct random in-game identification checks. Therefore, each participant shall be able to present his/her Comet Card at the game site upon request. Participants may also be required to supply additional identifiable information (class schedule, driver's license, etc.) in order to verify their identity for participation in an intramural game or event. If it is determined that the given information or Comet Card is invalid, the game may be forfeited for use of an ineligible player. Game time is forfeit time. Teams must be signed in and ready to play at game time. A forfeit is recorded as a loss and results in a sportsmanship rating of ""0."" The first forfeit will result in the loss of the forfeit fee and the second forfeit will result in the team being dropped from that league. If a team/individual forfeits once during the regular season, they may regain playoff eligibility with a one-time, playoff reinstatement payment of $30. This payment must be made before 5 p.m. on the following business day. Due to the busy schedules of most students, there will be times when a team or individual will not be able to make their scheduled game. In this instance, the team or individual may communicate to the Intramural Sports office via email or phone that they will not be present. This must be done by 5 p.m. on the day of the scheduled game to allow enough time to call the opposing team or individual and to make any other personnel changes that may result. In the event of a default, the team or individual will: Receive a loss. Not be assigned any sportsmanship rating. Still be eligible for the playoffs. Be eligible to get their forfeit fee returned. Games that are rained out are not guaranteed to be rescheduled, but may be rescheduled at the discretion of the assistant director of Competitive Sports. In the event a game cannot be rescheduled, each team will receive a win for the scheduled contest. In case of inclement weather, messages will be sent from administration through email and text via IMLeagues and announcements will be shared on University Recreation social media handles @utdurec for Instagram , Facebook and X (Twitter) . Absolutely no alcohol or tobacco is allowed in the Intramural playing areas. If either is present, the contest will not be played and will be considered a forfeit. This policy includes spectators. The supervisor and/or officials have the authority and responsibility to make decisions regarding students who are not permitted to play. University Police may be notified. Participation is a privilege, not a right. The Sportsmanship Rating System is intended to be an objective scale by which teams' attitudes and behaviors can be assessed throughout the Intramural Sports league and playoff seasons. Behavior before, during and after an Intramural Sports contest is included in the rating. The team captain is responsible for educating and informing all players and spectators affiliated with his/her team about the system. Teams are responsible for the actions of their individual team members and spectators. The team captain's efforts in assisting officials/staff to calm difficult situations and to restrain troubled teammates are imperative to controlling team conduct. Sportsmanship is vital to the conduct of every intramural contest. In order to encourage proper conduct during games, officials, administrative personnel and supervisors shall make decisions on whether to warn, penalize, or eject players, spectators, or teams for poor sportsmanship. These decisions are final. The Intramural Sports administrative staff will rule on further penalties as a result of unsportsmanlike conduct. Each participant should choose his or her team members carefully, as all team members will suffer the consequences of any disciplinary action taken by the Intramural Sports staff against the team for violation of the Intramural rules and sportsmanship guidelines. Intramural Sports reserves the right to amend any policy without prior notice. Any policy not mentioned herein is left to the discretion of the assistant director of Competitive Sports.

https://studenthealthcenter.utdallas.edu/resources/mosquito-viruses,Mosquito Viruses | Student Health Center | UT Dallas,General Information,"According to Dallas County Health and Human Services (DCHHS), there have been no reports of locally-acquired cases of Chikungunya, Dengue and Zika viruses. However, imported cases make local spread possible because the mosquitoes that can transmit those viruses are found in Dallas County. Mosquito season in Dallas County is officially from May to October, but DCHHS has seen mosquito activity in other months while conducting year-round surveillance. Chikungunya, Dengue and Zika viruses are not spread directly from person to person. All three viruses are spread by the bite of an infected Aedes species mosquito. The mosquitoes are aggressive daytime biters, prefer to bite people, and live indoors and outdoors near people. Mosquitoes become infected when they feed on a person already infected with one of the viruses. Infected mosquitoes can then spread it to other people. Chikungunya, Dengue and Zika viruses are endemic to tropical regions such as Central and South America, and the Caribbean."
https://studenthealthcenter.utdallas.edu/resources/mosquito-viruses,Mosquito Viruses | Student Health Center | UT Dallas,Symptoms,"Although each virus has a unique set of symptoms, an infected person may experience fever, headache, rash, muscle or joint pain, usually within a week of being bitten by a mosquito carrying one of the viruses. There is no vaccine to prevent Chikungunya, Dengue or Zika. There is no specific treatment for any of the viruses. However, supportive therapy is helpful with managing symptoms."
https://studenthealthcenter.utdallas.edu/resources/mosquito-viruses,Mosquito Viruses | Student Health Center | UT Dallas,Prevention,"DCHHS recommends the 4Ds to reduce exposure to mosquitoes at all times: DEET all day, every day: Whenever you're outside, use insect repellents that contain DEET or other EPA approved repellents. Dress: Wear long, loose and light-colored clothing outside. Drain: Drain or treat all standing water in and around your home or workplace. Dusk & dawn: Limit outdoor activities during dusk and dawn when mosquitoes are most active."
https://studenthealthcenter.utdallas.edu/resources/mosquito-viruses,Mosquito Viruses | Student Health Center | UT Dallas,Travel,"Travelers with symptoms are advised to see a healthcare provider if they have visited an area where the viruses are present, and tell the healthcare provider when and where they traveled.

If we are not running a waitlist, you should hear from a trainer within two business days. If we are running a waitlist, you should be informed of such via an automated email once you submit your registration form. It is difficult to say exactly how long you may remain on the waitlist, as trainer pairings are dependent upon trainer schedules and staff size. The non-member price includes the daily use fee. You must have a Comet Card or driver's license when entering the building. Personal training sessions do not expire. Unfortunately, you cannot get a refund once you purchase sessions, unless it is for medical reasons (bring a doctor's note saying you cannot work out anymore). However, if you decide not to train, you can transfer your unused sessions to a family member or friend. All of our personal trainers have a personal training certification they must maintain for the duration of their employment. All of our trainers are also certified in Red Cross CPR/AED. We understand life is full of the unexpected. Contact your trainer by either email or phone. If you have the trainer's personal cell phone number, call and leave a message. If not, contact the Activity Center front control desk at 972-883-2090 and leave a message with your name and trainer's name.

https://urec.utdallas.edu/programs/outdoors-2/climbing-wall,Climbing Wall - University Recreation | The University of Texas at Dallas,FAQ,"Bouldering is a form of free climbing that is performed on artificial rock walls without the use of ropes or harnesses. Top rope climbing is a form of rock climbing where the climber is securely attached to a climbing rope that runs through a fixed anchor at the top of the climbing route, and back down to the belayer (or ""second"") at the base of the climb. To let climbers know the difficulty of a rock-climbing routes, rock-climbing locations use the V scale or Yosemite Decimal System (YDS). The V scale has grades from V0 to V17. The lower the number, the easier the climb. For example, a V5 route is easier than a V12. Most indoor rock climbing gyms also use VB, with B standing for beginners. First-time rock climbers should stick to VB, V0, and V1 routes. The YDS system has grades from 5.0 to 5.15d. The number 5 shows the steepness of a route. Like the V scale, the higher the number, the harder the route. Grades 5.0 to 5.7 are routes for beginners, while 5.13 to 5.15 are routes for experienced rock climbers. Inside of the Activity Center in the Axillary Gym. Yes, we provide the following items: climbing shoes, harness, chalk bags, chalk, and information on the PBUS system used to belay a climber. All participants must pass an orientation/skills check each semester to climb. They are given on a daily basis."

The Library will also e-mail notices to borrowers when materials are recalled. [See Recalls section below]. Users are responsible for monitoring their UTD email accounts for any notifications about due date/time changes, courtesy reminders, and overdue items.

Proxy patrons must be UT Dallas students or staff with a valid current UTD ID (Comet Card) and must be approved by the Head of Access Services. The Library sends notices as a courtesy only. The Library is NOT responsible for non-delivery of notices. Please advise the Library of a change in contact information to ensure your notices arrive.

According to the Texas Public Information Act (as amended 1999) and in accord with established principles guiding the provision of library services, staff members may not release the names of borrowers who are using or who have used library materials or services. Exceptions are made only upon court order, subpoena, or warrant, or when deemed necessary by University officials for internal investigations.The Vice President of the Office of Administration is the University's liaison with judicial and law enforcement authorities in matters regarding official records of the University. A UT Dallas Library staff member may not release information except to the office of The Vice President of the Office of Administration or to a UT Dallas Libraries administrator to be passed on to that office, except in the case of a warrant which is immediately executable. The University of Texas System Business Procedures Memorandum 32-06-05, Texas Public Information Act , establishes each component institution's Chief Financial Officer as the custodian of records for that institution. The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act (USA PATRIOT Act) became law on October 26, 2001. Under provisions of the act, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and other law enforcement officials may seek court orders for library records for investigations relevant to national security or terrorism. Libraries or library staff served with these search warrants may not disclose, under penalty of law, the existence of the warrants or the fact that records were produced as a result of the warrants. Borrowers cannot be told their records were given to law enforcement agencies or that they were the subjects of FBI investigations. The USA PATRIOT Act overrides state library confidentiality laws protecting library records and the libraries will comply with it. The libraries' policy relating to privacy and confidentiality of information has not changed as a result of the act.Many provisions of the PATRIOT Act, including the section that relates to libraries, expire automatically on December 31, 2005, unless renewed by Congress. The UT Dallas Libraries keep the minimum number of records necessary to maintain operations. For example, when a user logs off a library computer, the library does not retain information that connects the user to activities performed during the session. When a borrower returns materials to the library, if no fines or fees are assessed, the patron's link to the item information  is automatically dropped.

The History of the Book Collection was created to illustrate a number of rare types and examples of the creativity to be found in the creation of the book. Hevres Nouvellles Tirées de la Sainte Ecriture – Louis Senault, 1720? A French book of hours (an illustrated devotional book of prayers, parables, and religious information), this book honors Saint Roch (a 14th century French Saint associated with curing the plague) and may be connected to calling for the Saint's intercession during a 1720 outbreakof the plague in the port city of Marseilles in 1720. Juvenalis. Persius – Decimus Junius Juvénal, 1801 Printed as part of the Augustinian revival and fashion for things related to the ancient Roman Empire, that swept Europe in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, this volume contains sixteen satires penned by the Roman poet Juvenal (ca. 60 –ca. 130) as well as six satires by the Stoic philosopher Persius (34-62). Of note is that these satires are written in the form of acrostics, where the first letter of each line form a word or message vertically down the page. The Pleasures of Reason: Or the Hundred Thoughts of a Sensible Young Lady – Robert Gillet, 1796 Typical of many works of the 18th century, this a book designed to serve as a ""conduct manual"" for a young lady, offering advice on how to act rationally, perform good works, manage a household, and other related topics. La Corbeillie de Fruits – Charles Malo [1815 –1821] This book provides a guide for the planting, harvesting, and use of 11 different kinds of fruit, with each fruit illustrated by a colored engraving. The English Bijou Almanac The miniature book on display in this collection is The English Bijou Almanac for 1836. Published by Albert Schloss, the book features six engraved portraits of famous figures of arts and culture (this volume includes Lord Byron and the Renaissance Master Raphael), as well as poems by Letitia Elizabeth Landon, a 19th century English woman of letters. The book also contained a calendar, and a list of the members of the British Royal Family as well as the Crown Heads of Europe. These miniature books illustrated just one of the many ways bookmaking has been turned into an elaborate art form over the years. Specimens of the Early English Poets – Edited by George Ellis 1790 This rare volume of English poetry, printed by Edwards of Halifax, is a fine example of the book art of fore-edge painting. Fore-edge painting is a technique whereby an image is painted on the front part of the book, visible when the pages are fanned. Fore-edge paintings often depict country scenes of great estates and parklands. Hevres Nouvellles Tirées de la Sainte Ecriture – Louis Senault, 1720?

Some areas of note in the collection include Confederate postal history, the detection of forgeries, postal histories of U.S. states, and air mail philately. The library is also home to the records of the Texas Philatelic Association, Inc. and the San Antonio Philatelic Association. The WPRL is supported by the proceeds of its own endowment fund, which was created at its founding by Mr. Wineburgh and has grown through the generosity of our many philatelic friends from around the country. In addition to monetary donations, the library also benefits from in-kind gifts of books, journals, and other materials on philately, postal history, and related subject areas. Anyone wishing to make a donation may contact the Special Collections Department using the information given on this page.

The Library will also e-mail notices to borrowers when materials are recalled. [See Recalls section below]. Users are responsible for monitoring their UTD email accounts for any notifications about due date/time changes, courtesy reminders, and overdue items. A faculty member may appoint students or staff members as a proxy patron to check out materials on the Faculty member's account. Proxy patrons must be UT Dallas students or staff with a valid current UTD ID (Comet Card) and must be approved by the Head of Access Services. The Library sends notices as a courtesy only. The Library is NOT responsible for non-delivery of notices. Please advise the Library of a change in contact information to ensure your notices arrive.

Item due dates are valid as long as the library building is open, including during university breaks. To verify current building hours, please contact the main services desk at 972.883.2953. Borrowers may renew materials through Discover , at the Services Desk, or via phone at (972) 883-2955. There are limits on renewals based on borrower level and the type of item. The item will not be renewed if it has been recalled for another borrower, if borrowing privileges have expired, if fine limits are exceeded, or if the patron has overdue items. For questions about fines or checkout periods please refer to the Borrowing From the Library list. Continuing Faculty and graduate students' borrowed items will renew automatically at the end of each semester as a courtesy. Borrowers are responsible for ensuring their items are renewed. Renewal is prevented by fines, blocks, overdue items, recalls, or reaching the 6-renewal limit. Graduate students must be fully enrolled for the next semester to get auto-renewal. Interlibrary loan (ILL) books do not renew automatically. Borrowers must pay late fines if renewal fails. A recall allows a patron to request most materials that are checked out or the library staff to request materials for course reserves. Recalled items may not be renewed. Recall requests may be submitted through Discover or by calling the Information Desk at (972) 883-2955. The initial borrower will be notified by email of any due date change. Borrowers with semester-long checkouts will be given 21 days to return a recalled item. If the item is not returned by the new due date, recall fines of $1/day go into effect. When the item is returned, the requestor is notified by email, and the item is held at the Services Desk for 7 days. If material is missing from the shelves, library staff will conduct a search by request at the Services Desk. If located, library staff will notify the requestor of the results and hold the material at the Services Desk for 7 days. Materials that are long overdue will be declared lost. If an item that a borrower has checked out is lost or irreparably damaged, the borrower will be assessed a replacement fee that reflects the replacement cost of the material as determined by the library. In addition to replacement fees, the borrower will be assessed a $25 processing fee, as well as any existing overdue fines. Items more than 30 days overdue will be considered lost, and the borrower will be responsible for the replacement costs, a $25 processing fee, and any applicable late fees.

Historically, the Board of Regents has not asserted an ownership interest in copyright of scholarly or educational materials (among other items) related to a faculty author's academic or professional field, regardless of the medium of expression. The Regents have always encouraged faculty creators to manage their copyrights consistent with best practices and applicable institutional policies. The Board of Regents recognizes that it and its member universities strive to attract private and public sources of high quality sponsored research funding, and for its faculty to receive that support. As such, if desirable research sponsorship is to grow and continue, the Board of Regents and its member universities must from time to time accede to the requirements of sponsor terms. Recently, certain research sponsor guidelines have changed. Many funders, including federal agencies and private foundations , now mandate public availability of specific publication of research data and related scholarly works."
https://library.utdallas.edu/library/research-instruction/openaccess,Public Access Mandates - Library | The University of Texas at Dallas,Tools and Resources,"As you prepare to comply with the Public Access mandate from your sponsor (a federal agency or a private foundation) you will often need to present those requirements to your publisher at the time of publication. In order to assist with that, we have created a list of resources, below. The SPARC Publication Addendum was created by the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC). SPARC works to enable the public sharing of research outputs and educational materials in order to democratize access to knowledge, accelerate discovery, and increase the return on our investment in research and education. Publishers often take more rights than are required for publication, so SPARC came up with a Publication Addendum that leaves more rights with the author than what traditional publication agreements do. As this agreement allows for the rights to reproduce, to distribute, to publicly perform, and to publicly display the Article in any medium for non-commercial purposes, this should allow you to deposit the work in the required place as required by the terms of the grant.

Leeker The History of Air America is a new e-book that covers the operational history of Air America. It is intended to serve as a narrative supplement to the database entitled The Aircraft of Air America published for the first time on 15 August 2003. Like its counterpart, The History of Air America is mostly based on material preserved at the Air America Archives at McDermott Library, The University of Texas at Dallas as well as on material taken from other sources like the USAF Aircraft Assignment Records preserved at the USAF Historical Research Agency at Maxwell AFB, the records of the Director General of Civil Aviation of the Republic of China at Taipei, and other archives. Already the 3rd edition of The Aircraft of Air America, published on 29 May 2006 contained some narrative files describing certain aspects of Air America's activities. These files have been taken out of the 4th edition of The Aircraft of Air America, updated and supplemented by more narrative files dealing with other aspects of Air America's history to form this new The History of Air America, which is, again, a work in progress. This means that not all files given below will be ready for publication from the beginning. As this e-book uses the same abbreviations, has been supported by the same people, and is based on the same sources as The Aircraft of Air America, there are no separate files called Abbreviations, Acknowledgments, and Bibliography for The History of Air America. Whoever is interested in these aspects, should consult the files given in the database called The Aircraft of Air America."

The University of Texas at Dallas, McDermott Library 11 August 2008 As no work of this nature can ever be considered to be complete or without errors, I kindly ask you to send all corrections and additions to the Department of Special Collections. They will kindly forward all material to me. © The University of Texas at Dallas, 11 August 2008 The updates of 1 June 2009 and 23 August 2010 to this database include three new files published here for the first time: – The early days I – CAT operations in China 1946-48 – The early days II – CAT operations in China 1949-50 – Air America – Cooperation with other airlines While the 2 files about the early days of CAT are mainly based on old CAT Bulletins preserved at the CAT / Air America Archives and on information about the aircraft flown by CAT prior to 1950 obtained from Princeton University Library, the file about Air America's cooperation with other airlines mainly deals with the Company's relations with Southern Air Transport, Bird and Sons, Continental Air Services, Boun Oum Airways and all those airlines who had handling contracts with Air America, particularly for services at Clark and Kadena Air Bases. The file Air America Japan has been considerably augmented at the beginning, dealing with the history of CAT prior to the Korean War. And the file Air America in South Vietnam III – the collapse has as well been increased with material recently released by the CIA like trip reports in which several Air America pilots describe in detail how they spent the last 2 days in South Vietnam, that is 28 and 29 April 1975. The updates contain new material that came from a number of new collections and sources. Among them, I'd like to especially mention the following new sources: The material donated to the Archives by Patricia F. Walker, M.D., daughter of Captain Frederick ""Fred"" Frye Walker. This material includes priceless documents like all types of Memoranda, Notams, Contracts, Radio messages, and Daily Flight Schedules of several Air America bases, including the Saigon Daily Flight Schedules of 28 and 29 April 1975, that is of the last two days Air America was in operation. The photos sent to the author for publication by Dr. Jonathan Pote, documenting his one-year stay in Laos in 1965/66. These photos were very helpful for the sections about Continental Air Services and Boun Oum Airways. CIA material released in 2009. In the History, trip reports documenting Air America flights during the evacuation of Saigon as well as various commendations illustrate the heroism shown by Air America flight crews on many occasions. The material supplied by Princeton University Library, which includes the only known official list of aircraft operated by CAT between 1947 and 1950. Once again, I kindly ask to send all corrections and all further additions to the Department of Special Collections. They will kindly forward all material to me. © The University of Texas at Dallas, 11 August 2008, last updated on 23 August 2010 This second edition of The History of Air America, dated 4 March 2013, includes 7 new files published here for the first time: CAT, Air Asia, Air America – the Company on Taiwan I: Structure and Development CAT, Air Asia, Air America – the Company on Taiwan II: Scheduled and Civilian Charter Flights CAT, Air Asia, Air America – the Company on Taiwan III: Work for the US Government CAT, Air Asia, Air America – the Company on Taiwan IV: Maintenance Smaller Operations: Kadena Air Base, Clark Air Base Working in Remote Countries: CAT in New Zealand, Thailand-Burma, French Indochina, Guatemala, and Indonesia CAT and Air America in Japan The file ""Air America Japan"" has been completely reworked and has now become ""CAT and Air America in Japan"", dealing in detail with CAT's activities during the Korean War. Details about CAT's operations in Guatemala, Indonesia, and French Indochina have been considerably increased and can now be found in the new file ""Working in Remote Countries"", which also contains activities not mentioned before like Operation ""Icebox"" and the New Zealand operation. These new files are mainly based on material preserved at the Air America Archives like CAT Bulletins and the priceless material contained in the boxes of Professor William Leary. This includes, for example, the Memoirs of CAT pilot Connie Seigrist and all the interviews once conducted by Professor Leary with numerous CAT and Air America people. The material preserved at the Air America Archives also comes from the boxes of Joe Rosbert, CAT's Director of Operations, and from the microfilms supplied by Gary Bisson. Very helpful were the log books of CAT pilots Connie Seigrist and especially ""Doc"" Johnson, scans of which have been kindly supplied by the sons of these pilots, i.e. by Steve Seigrist and James Johnson. Without the indefatigable efforts especially of James Johnson it would have been impossible to document and illustrate many of CAT's and Air America's ""black"" missions. © The University of Texas at Dallas, 11 August 2008, last updated on 4 March 2013 This final version of the second edition of The History of Air America, dated 24 August 2015, includes 4 new files published here for the first time: Company Management I – 1947-59 Company Management II – 1959-73 Company Management III – 1973-77 Air America in Thailand – since the days of CAT While the file about Air America in Thailand follows the same pattern as the files about Air America in Laos or South Vietnam, so is arranged by contracts, types of operations, and periods of time, the 3 new files called Company Management, Administration, and Ground Support I, II, and III try to explain how CAT, Air Asia, and Air America were functioning behind the visible world of the flight crews – at Washington, at Taipei and on the level of an Air America base or station. At the same time, these files try to list all people who worked at a certain position at a certain place. As these lists are not based on any official Company roster of employees, but only on those documents that were available to me, this information is necessarily incomplete. What else is new in this ""final"" version of my History of Air America? –  There are several new chapters in Air America in Laos. One of them (in Humanitarian work, part 2) deals with Air America working in USAID's anti-narcotics programs and also tries to disprove the false allegations of drug running; another one (in Humanitarian work, part 1) gives new details about Air America's SAR work; still another one of them (in Military aid, part 1) deals with the Seaboard World Services episode; and to all of them, many details about the historical background have been added. –  The file Missions to Tibet now has new details extracted from the log book of Merrill D. (""Doc"") Johnson. –  A new chapter (about Air Ventures) and many details (mostly about CASI) have been added to the file Cooperation with other airlines. –  The file CAT, Air Asia, Air America – the Company on Taiwan III: Work for the US Government now contains details about the B-17s used by CAT and the RoCAF. –  The file CAT, Air Asia, Air America – the Company on Taiwan IV: Technical Services Division now has, at its end, a summary of the history of Air Asia from its sale to E-Systems in 1975 to today. After more than 21 years of work, I can finally say that The Aircraft of Air America and The History of Air America have been completed. Looking back, I am very happy to say that many people have assisted me over the years with the information they sent me – too many to mention here all of them. Whoever has assisted me in writing first The Aircraft of Air America and then The History of Air America is listed in the ""Acknowledgments"" file of The Aircraft – there is no separate ""Acknowledgments"" file for the History, as in many cases the material sent to me has been used in both e-books. However, I want to thank especially two persons whom I could contact for help for very many years and without whose indefatigable assistance these two e-books would not have been possible: the late Ward Reimer and Joe Hazen. So once again, many, many thanks! There are also two institutions whom I'd like to thank here for their assistance: The staff of the Department of Special Collections of UTD was always very helpful – not only by making accessible to me the CAT and Air America material that had been donated to them, but also by arranging whatever they could, so that during my one week trips to Dallas I could check as much material as possible, and by their patience, trying to answer all of my questions that I sometimes sent them from home via e-mail. So thank you very much, Special Collections! The other institution I'd like to thank is the CIA – for generously declassifying an enormous amount of precious documents about CAT and Air America. Already in 1997 or 1998, the first shipments of the ""CIA Corporate Records"" arrived at Special Collections, followed by more declassified material over the years. In the meantime, CIA's Electronic Reading Room is another source of information, without whom it would have been impossible to write these two e-books. So thank you very much, Declassification Staff! It was in 1994 that I started to work on Air America, and my first visit to the McDermott Library of UTD was in 1996. Since then, several collections have been revised and so, probably a lot of material that has been quoted in my references by box and folder number, may have changed its box or folder within the same collection and so may have been given new box and folder numbers. Whenever it was possible, I tried to indicate the new box and folder numbers. As this has not always been possible, readers and patrons should ask a librarian when they are unable to locate in the library a document that I quoted. © The University of Texas at Dallas, 11 August 2008, last updated on 24 August 2015"

The files about the Khmer Air Force and RLAF T-28s  and O-1s have been revised thanks to material coming from the National  Archives, provided by Sid Nanson and Steve Darke The identities of the ""Peace Rotor"" UH-34s prepared by Air America's maintenance base at Udorn and delivered by Air America pilots to  Indonesia have come to light. 3 new files have been added to the RLAF section:  T-6s, Sikorsky SH-19s, and Alouette IIs After more than  21 years of work, I can finally say that The  Aircraft of Air America and The History of Air America has been completed. Looking back, I am very happy to say that many people have assisted me over the years with the information they sent me – too many to mention here all of them. Whoever has assisted me in writing first The Aircraft of Air America and then The History of Air America is listed in the ""Acknowledgments"" file of The Aircraft – there is no separate ""Acknowledgments"" file for the History , as in many cases the material sent to me has been used in both e-books. However, I want to thank especially two persons whom I could contact for help for very many years and without whose indefatigable assistance these two e-books would not have been possible: the late Ward Reimer and Joe Hazen. So once again, many, many thanks! There are also two institutions whom I'd like to thank here for their assistance: The staff of the History of Aviation & Archives of UTD was always very helpful – not only by making accessible to me the CAT and Air  America material that had been donated to them, but also by arranging whatever they could, so that during my one-week trips to Dallas I could check as much material as possible, and by their patience, trying to answer all of my questions that I sometimes sent them from home via e-mail. So thank you very much, Special Collections! The other institution I'd like to thank is the CIA –  for generously declassifying an enormous amount of precious documents about CAT  and Air America. Already in 1997 or 1998, the first shipments of the ""CIA  Corporate Records"" arrived at Special Collections, followed by more declassified material over the years. In the meantime, CIA's Electronic Reading  Room is another source of information, without whom it would have been impossible to write these two e-books. So thank you very much, Declassification  Staff! utdallas.edu It was in 1994 that I started to work on Air America, and my first visit to the McDermott Library of UTD was in 1996. Since then, several collections have been revised and so, probably a lot of material that has been quoted in my references by box and folder number, may have changed its box or folder within the same collection and so may have been given new box and folder numbers. Whenever it was possible, I tried to indicate the new box and folder numbers. As this has not always been possible, readers and patrons should ask a  librarian when they are unable to locate in the library a document that I  quoted. © University of Texas at Dallas, 15 August 2003, last updated on 24  August 2015"

https://library.utdallas.edu/research-instruction/openaccess,Public Access Mandates - Library | The University of Texas at Dallas,Public Access Mandates,"UT System Board of Regents Rule 90101 covers intellectual property output from sponsored projects in the University setting, including academic copyright, and publication and use of scholarly articles and research data. Historically, the Board of Regents has not asserted an ownership interest in copyright of scholarly or educational materials (among other items) related to a faculty author's academic or professional field, regardless of the medium of expression. The Regents have always encouraged faculty creators to manage their copyrights consistent with best practices and applicable institutional policies. The Board of Regents recognizes that it and its member universities strive to attract private and public sources of high quality sponsored research funding, and for its faculty to receive that support. As such, if desirable research sponsorship is to grow and continue, the Board of Regents and its member universities must from time to time accede to the requirements of sponsor terms. Recently, certain research sponsor guidelines have changed. Many funders, including federal agencies and private foundations , now mandate public availability of specific publication of research data and related scholarly works."
https://library.utdallas.edu/research-instruction/openaccess,Public Access Mandates - Library | The University of Texas at Dallas,Tools and Resources,"As you prepare to comply with the Public Access mandate from your sponsor (a federal agency or a private foundation) you will often need to present those requirements to your publisher at the time of publication. In order to assist with that, we have created a list of resources, below. The SPARC Publication Addendum was created by the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC). SPARC works to enable the public sharing of research outputs and educational materials in order to democratize access to knowledge, accelerate discovery, and increase the return on our investment in research and education. Publishers often take more rights than are required for publication, so SPARC came up with a Publication Addendum that leaves more rights with the author than what traditional publication agreements do. As this agreement allows for the rights to reproduce, to distribute, to publicly perform, and to publicly display the Article in any medium for non-commercial purposes, this should allow you to deposit the work in the required place as required by the terms of the grant.
